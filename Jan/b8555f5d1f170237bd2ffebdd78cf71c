The SABC’s Bloemfontein premises has been cleared for operations after an intruder was shot and wounded in the early hours of Sunday morning. He was shot following the scuffle with the security. Several suspicious parcels have been seized from the suspect.  The Hawks and police’s bomb squad were called in and are investigating. The suspect had also spray-painted corridor walls with graffiti. Police are also investigating a separate case after a Facebook user allegedly incited the public to burn Lesedi FM offices at SABC’s Bloemfontein premises. The SABC’s Free State and Northern Cape regional operations manager, Mandla Mbusi, says they are alarmed at how the intruder gained entry into the building. “We were informed by our security personnel that a person came inside our building illegally. And for now, we are assuming that he used the emergency exit points to enter the building. And the person was confronted by our security guards and there was a shooting incident. The person is currently in hospital under police guards.”
