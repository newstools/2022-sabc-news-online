The Western Cape Department of Agriculture’s State Veterinary Services has served a quarantine notice on pig farmers at Thembalethu in George in the Southern Cape after African Swine Fever was detected in the area. The virus was also detected at Kwanonqaba near Mossel Bay earlier this month. The quarantine notice urges community members and pig farmers not to remove any pigs or products from the area to prevent further spreading of the disease. Head of Veterinary Services, Dr Gininda Msiza, says carcasses should be disposed of safely and pigs should be confined to prevent roaming. Msiza says hands, shoes, clothing, and equipment must be sanitised before and after contact with pigs – and meat products should be thoroughly cooked before being fed to animals.
