A member of the AmaZulu royal family is believed to be seeking an interdict to prevent King MisuZulu KaZwelithini from addressing the commemoration of the Battle of iSandlwana. The iconic event in the AmaZulu calendar is expected to be held on Saturday at Nquthu, in the northern part of KwaZulu-Natal. The member has, through his lawyer, approached the High Court in Pietermaritzburg. They are arguing that King MisuZulu is not supposed to address any royal events since there is still an ongoing court battle for the kingship. Peter Zwane is the lawyer representing the said member from the AmaZulu royal family says they are in a process of issuing an interdict. “We are in a process of issuing an urgent interdict, seeking to interdict Prince MisuZulu from addressing the commemoration of the Battle of iSandlwana tomorrow ( on Saturday) in Nquthu,” says Zwane. Zwane says King MisuZulu is not the King of the Zulu nation. “It is one of the most important events in the KwaZulu royal family or Zulu nation calendar to be addressed by the King of the Zulu nation. And as everyone knows that Prince MisuZulu is not a King of the Zulu nation or his nomination to the throne is subject of court challenges,” says Zwane.
