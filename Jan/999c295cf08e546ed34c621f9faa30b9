Police have arrested a 50-year-old man suspected to be a serial rapist at Malukazi south of Durban. The suspect is believed to be linked to 20 separate rape cases. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says the first rape case was reported in 2008. In August last year, a woman said that she had been strangled and raped in Isipingo. Gwala says that’s when police started to see how linked the cases were. “Yesterday, the detectives from Inanda Family Violence Unity arrested a fifty-year-old suspect at Malukazi for rape and the first reported case date back in 2008 where the suspect was targeting victims in the Durban CBD. He would ask them to accompany him to Isipingo because he did not know the area or he would offer some assistance to the victims who were in distress. The suspect would rape the victim in a secluded area and the last incident was reported on the 20th of August last year where the victim was strangled and raped at Isipingo and charges of rape were opened at Isipingo. The suspect is tomorrow in court facing charges of rape.”
