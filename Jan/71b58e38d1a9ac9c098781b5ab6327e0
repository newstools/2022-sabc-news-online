Protest action has flared up at the University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Westville campus in Durban. It is alleged that about 30 people blocked the main entrance to the university with burning tyres and debris. Last week, a university guardhouse and a security vehicle were damaged in a violent demonstration when a group of about 50 students tried to force their way onto the same campus. KwaZulu-Natal Police Spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says: “This morning (Monday) at 6:00 about 30 people blocked the university main gate on University Drive in Westville. They were burning tyres and they were dispersed, and the situation is quiet at the moment.” *Monday 31/01/2022* *06:30* *KZN* *Protest* Protesting at the entrance of UKZN.
