FREE STATE IS NUMBER 1 Well done to the class of Class of 2021 pic.twitter.com/wOSAwuM9Bu — FS Government (@fsgov) January 20, 2022  Makgoe says they succeeded in motivating the learners. “The parents played a significant role as you know these two years. We had huge problems with COVID-19, then we had to depend on parents in supporting their learners and those who had access to things like online learning but also the teachers themselves. One thing we did slightly different from other provinces is that our schooling was 7-days of the week. We also mobilised them to churches, we know that doesn’t necessarily improve their performances because of the prayer but it motivates them.” Free State matric results – some statistics The Free State has proven to be the province to beat, outperforming all provinces and retaining the highest matric pass rate since 2016.
