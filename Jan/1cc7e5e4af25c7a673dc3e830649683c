The class of 2021 has been lauded for obtaining the highest number of Bachelor passes since the dawn of democracy. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga who announced the 2021 matric results Johannesburg last night says this is the highest in the history of the NSC examinations. Over 256 000 bachelor passes have been recorded totalling 36%. The national overall pass rate is standing at 76.4%.  Basic Education Minister Motshekga says the class of 2021 has performed exceptionally well. The Free State province is on top of the chart while Limpopo comes last at less than 70%. Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal contributed to the most number of Bachelor passes, with 117 704 between the two provinces. Motshekga acknowledges the problems in the education system and says she’s working on addressing the challenges including working on improving Limpopo.  Learners from the province of Gauteng are among some of the top performing learners in the NSC examinations countrywide. Gauteng achieved a 82.8% pass rate which is a 1.0% decline from 2020. Education Specialist Mary Matcalfe says the results are a clear indication that different provinces are faced with different challenges.
