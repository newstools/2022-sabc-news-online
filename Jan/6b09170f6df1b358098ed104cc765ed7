The Free State Department of Education has criticised government official Tshediso Mangope for posting a controversial message on Facebook. The post which has been deleted has now gone viral. Mangope is an advisor to Cooperative Governance MEC, Mxolisi Dukwana who is also ANC Free State convenor. He questioned the teaching abilities of the South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu) members, implying that he would not subject his children to them. He also posted images of scantily-dressed women in a compromising position, labelling them as Sadtu members. The provincial Education Department’s Howard Ndaba says, “MEC of Education in the Free State province, Tate Makgoe condemned the post with abhorrence and disdain it deserves. MEC Makgoe hopes that Mangope will face sanction by his department. His posts amount to racism, sexism and blatant abuse of our teachers who have contributed immensely to the education of our children especially the historically disadvantaged learners.” Meanwhile, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says she is relieved that learners are back to school in inland provinces. On Wednesday, the minister visited three schools in Randfontein, Gauteng, to check on their readiness as the 2022 academic year kicks off in inland provinces. Motshekga says classes will continue on a rotational basis in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19. Interview with Minister Motshekga:
