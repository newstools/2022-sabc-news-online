One of the country’s top matric learners in 2021 has encouraged others with disabilities not to let their condition determine their future. Nineteen-year-old Lethabo Maleka from Ga-Mphahlele outside Lebowakgomo in Limpopo, who is blind, achieved six distinctions.  Maleka was a learner at Setotolwane Secondary School. He says his teachers, friends and parents supported him throughout his studies. He lost his eyesight from snake venom when he was young. Maleka was among the country’s top twenty achievers who were honoured by Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga. Maleka says that he will be pursuing a law degree at the University of Limpopo this year. “First of all, disabilities are not inability. It will never deter them from working hard or achieving good things in life. So they must not be discouraged by their disability. As long as they can get support from school or parents and everyone in their space, then everything will just be fine. They must just work hard and then life will go their way,” says Maleka. Maleka has also encouraged the matric class of 2022 to take their studies seriously, saying nothing is impossible. “I would like to advise them to work hard. They must be prepared to work hard and then persevere when it’s tough, but just keep ongoing throughout the year, and then hard work, hard work. There is even a saying that goes play hard and work even harder. That means you must work harder than you play, especially when it comes to Grade 12,” Maleka elaborates.
