Striking African National Congress (ANC) workers say they hope Tuesday’s meeting with the party’s Treasurer-General, Paul Mashatile, will resolve the non-payment of their salaries. The workers have vowed to stay away from work until their salary issue has been addressed. Some workers at Luthuli House have not been paid for three months. Following their meeting with ANC officials last Friday, it was resolved that their salaries would be paid on Saturday but that hasn’t happened. Workers’ representative, Mvusi Mdala says they are hoping for the issue to be resolved with immediate effect. “The expectation of that meeting is to be told that this challenge that we are facing is going to be resolved with immediate effect and then moving forward we are no longer going to experience what we have experienced since last year and even now; taking to account schools are opening and we had a black Christmas and starting January on a very bad note.” Last year, ANC staff said they have only been paid salaries for October in December. This is after the ruling party said it paid outstanding salaries for October and November and was processing December salaries, hoping to have paid all of them out before Christmas. Salaries were also not paid in July and August, as indicated in the tweet below: The @MYANC has once again failed to pay salaries of its staff members.

They also claim their Unemployment Insurance Fund contributions since 2018 and provident funds have not been paid. In June last year, staff members embarked on nationwide pickets to express their dissatisfaction with their leaders.
