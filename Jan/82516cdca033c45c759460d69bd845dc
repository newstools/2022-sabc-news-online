The City of Johannesburg Council meeting has been postponed yet again. The African National Congress (ANC), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and other minority parties staged a walkout of the council on Tuesday evening. However, COPE councillor Colleen Makhubele was elected as chair of chairs in council. It was done through an open vote, even though some parties opposed this, saying it must be a secret ballot.
