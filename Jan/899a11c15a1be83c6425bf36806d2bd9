The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) in the Western Cape has welcomed the denial of bail for alleged gang leader Nafiz Modack and his two alleged accomplices by the Bluedowns Magistrate’s court. Modack, Jacques Cronje and former SAPS anti-gang unit officer, Ashley Tabisher are facing a string of charges including extortion, conspiracy to commit murder and the attempted murder of Cape Town criminal lawyer, William Booth. The state, arguing against bail, said the murder of Anti-gang Unit Commander, Charl Kinnear, was in retaliation as the police investigation of Modack intensified. NPA spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila says the state has also argued that the three accused will intimidate witnesses, if granted bail. VIDEO: Alleged gang kingpin Nafiz Modack back in court
