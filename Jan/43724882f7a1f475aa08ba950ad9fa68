Police Minister Bheki Cele has reminded holidaymakers that despite the ending of the curfew that COVID-19 still exists and people need to continue following the remaining protocols like mask-wearing in public. Durban’s beaches were abuzz on New Year’s Day with beachgoers enjoying the sunny weather. Cele visited different beaches in the province monitoring safety and the deployment of police. He expressed concern over the disregard of COVID-19 safety protocols. “We’re not out of the woods, that’s why the presidential statement was very clear to say we’re not permanent. We said for now which means we will be assessing the situation. We hope we don’t go back there but the way I see we behave I’m scared that we might go back there. But for now, it’s good for South Africans. They’ve been depressed, they have been in a big prison after lockdown so it’s good that people are allowed to enjoy but responsibility should be part of their enjoyment,” says Cele. COVID-19 Lockdown I SA lifts the curfew and there are now no restrictions on the movement of people :  Cele says crime has dropped this festive season. “It looks like we are very down when it comes to the crime this time of the year. I checked both KZN and checked Gauteng. Gauteng, there is very good success in terms of the roadblocks, arresting, firearms, drugs. We had a little bit of a problem in Western Cape where 10 people were shot and killed last night after coming from the happiness,” says Cele. #PoliceMinistry #SaferFestiveSeason Inspection Tour underway in KwaZulu-Natal.
