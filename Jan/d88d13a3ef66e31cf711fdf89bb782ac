The African National Congress (ANC) has acknowledged that it needs to deal with corruption in its own ranks before attempting to deal with the scourge in broader society. Party spokesperson Pule Mabe says the organisation will be rolling out its renewal commission this year as outlined in its planning meeting held from the 20th to 23rd of this month. Mabe says the ANC recognises it is on a downward spiral and needs to do things differently. “This year we’re going to our 55th national congress, when we arrive at that important occasion, the committee led by former President Kgalema Motlanthe must be able to develop a framework, guidelines that govern how cadres of the movement are expected to carry themselves towards that elective conference – including how they contest so that we could rid that conference of corruption, and buying of delegates.” Party admits it is on a downward spiral: Pule Mabe
