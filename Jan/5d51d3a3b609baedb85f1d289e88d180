Former African National Congress (ANC) Presidents Thabo Mbeki, Jacob Zuma and Kgalema Motlanthe are not at the Old Peter Mokaba stadium in Polokwane where party President Cyril Ramaphosa will soon deliver the January eight statement to mark the ANC’s 110th anniversary. But senior ANC leaders  including national chairperson Gwede Mantashe, Deputy President David Mabuza have arrived at the stadium. Mashatile says the statement will focus on both internal party and national challenges. January 8 Statement I Mabuza, Mantashe and Mashatile arrive:  He says they’ve seen that South Africans are fast losing confidence in the ANC because of the way it has been conducting itself as a governing party. Mashatile says  Ramaphosa will outline clear guidelines on how the ANC can be renewed to enable it to improve the quality of  citizens’ lives. “One of the things that the president is going to address is the issues of service delivery. At the dinner yesterday, he did hint that he will talk about issues of economy, service delivery. So it’s all the speech. We are here not only to talk about the ANC, but issues affecting the nation.”
