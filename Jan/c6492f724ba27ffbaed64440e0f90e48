Police Minister Bheki Cele has told the media that someone deliberately disrupted electricity supply at the African National Congress (ANC) gala dinner in Polokwane on Friday night. He says this happened when party President Cyril Ramaphosa was making his closing remarks in which he was thanking business leaders. ANC celebrates its 110th anniversary this Saturday in Polokwane: Ramaphosa’s address was a prelude to January 8 statement which he will deliver at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium to celebrate the party’s 110th anniversary. ANC members and some officials are fast filling up the stadium where COVID-19 protocols are being observed. ANC head of organising events Nomvula Mokonyane says the statement remains significant in 2022. Meanwhile, the ANC in Limpopo says it is concerned that its leadership has not been provided with an immediate explanation about what led to a power cut that interrupted President Cyril Ramaphosa’s address at a fundraising gala dinner last night. He, however, managed to finish his address by thanking the ANC in Limpopo for organising events in the build-up to the ANC January eight statement to celebrate the party’s 110th anniversary. Provincial secretary Soviet Lekganyane says they are concerned about the sudden electrical problem. “The manner in which the electricity went off is inexplicable it is still a mystery. I don’t know know how we can explain except for any technician or engineer who can make an investigation and come out with a reasonable explanation about what could have happened. Off-course it is a serious concern we have seen incidents happening throughout the country which are an attack on our democracy so when you have the head of state in fact not only the head of state the whole leadership of the state gathered at one point and you have an occurrence like this one it is a national security concern.” Roads closed around Polokwane ahead of ANC’s 110th celebrations:
