The Judicial Conduct Appeals Tribunal has concurred with the Judicial Conduct Committee’s (JCC) decision to request Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to issue an unconditional apology for his pro-Israel comments. Mogoeng appealed the JCC’s decision and refused to apologise. The Judicial Conduct Committee found him guilty following a complaint laid by the South African Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Coalition, Africa4Palestine and Women’s Cultural Group. He made the pro-Israel comments at a webinar that an Israeli newspaper the Jerusalem Post has hosted in June 2020.
