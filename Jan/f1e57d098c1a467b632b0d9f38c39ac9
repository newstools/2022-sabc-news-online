The Speaker of the National Assembly Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula says an investigation to determine if fire systems at Parliament were compliant with regulations will commence once the precinct has been declared safe for inspection. The fire caused extensive damage to the National Assembly building and office space. Firefighters were today thanked by government officials during a ceremony at the Roeland Street Fire Station. “Even the Department of Public Works couldn’t have access to the building. We rely on information that will come from engineers who will tell us whether in fact, we can go into the building to view what has happened there. But also you should remember, even when the firefighters have left the Parliamentary Precinct, we still should remember that that’s a crime scene, so we must be guided as to when and what we can do in that area,” says Mapisa-Nqakula.
