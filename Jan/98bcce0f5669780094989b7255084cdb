The department says assessment on the magnitude of the damage is still under way ahead of the reopening of schools in the province next week. Education Department spokesperson Geoffrey Van Der Merwe says, “We condemn these incidents in the strongest terms and appeal to all school communities to work with the SAPS to ensure that these perpetrators are arrested and face the full might of the law. Our infrastructure unit is still conducting an assessment of the damage caused to do the reparation work.” Back to school | Minister Angie Motshekga visits schools in the West Rand

Motshekga relieved learners are back at inland schools Meanwhile, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says she is relieved that learners are back to school in inland provinces. She is visiting three schools in Randfontein, Gauteng, to check on their readiness as the 2022 academic year kicks off in inland provinces. Coastal schools will reopen next week. Motshekga says classes will continue on a rotational basis in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19. The minister says she will only get a proper report after her visit to the schools. “Schools are as ready as they could be. The reports I’m getting from all the schools that we’ll be visiting is [about] the state of readiness, where they still have hitches with placements. I will not be able to give you the full impression about really comparing what I’m being told and what we have observed. But I’m just happy that we are back to school,” adds the minister.
