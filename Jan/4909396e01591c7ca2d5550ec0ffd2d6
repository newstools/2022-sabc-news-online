The South African Communist Party (SACP) in the Free State has reiterated its position that the African National Congress Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) should not rush into convening an elective conference. The communist party believes that the committee should focus on rebuilding and uniting the structures from the ground. The ANC’s National Working Committee announced the current Interim Provincial Committee last year, giving it a mandate to lead the province to the elective conference. The party in the province has experienced various challenges with its elective conferences in the past. Another hot contestation for top spot expected at ANC conference in December: Free State SACP second deputy secretary, Mojalefa Simango says conferences should be used to renew the party. “Let the ANC not rush to go to its conferences learning from the past in the province that the ANC has been dissolved either by its national structure your NEC. ANC has been dissolved by the courts and so forth. Learning from those lessons we have appealed to the ANC leadership at national level to say let this ANC in the Free State have time to rebuild itself, to rebuild the structures of the ANC but most importantly to rebuild the party activism as the leader of the alliance and the leader of government.”
