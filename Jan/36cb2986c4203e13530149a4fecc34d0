More than 10 000 households at Ha-Matsila and neighbouring villages, outside Louis Trichardt, in Limpopo, are set to benefit from a solar project which will power their boreholes. Power to operate the boreholes was previously supplied by Eskom. The project co-ordinator, Chief Livhuwani Matsila says the project will help to supply water to the communities. “The challenge has been that the boreholes that we have about ten or more were using electrical energy from eh and as you rightly say also because of load it has proved to be quite unreliable so we were not getting proper supply of water, inconsistent and abrupt sometimes so we decided to invest on solar energy,” says Chief Livhuwani Matsila. Residents say they are grateful that they will no longer have to pay for electricity and water. “It’s a pleasure and honour to have this project implemented in our village because if you look around or you go around the entire country most of the villages they are having this problem of water to us we are fortunate because we are going to use electricity without paying,” a resident explains.
