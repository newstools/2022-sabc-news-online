Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says she is relieved that learners are back to school in inland provinces. She is visiting three schools in Randfontein, Gauteng, to check on their readiness as the 2022 academic year kicks off in inland provinces. Coastal schools will reopen next week. Motshekga says classes will continue on a rotational basis in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19. The minister says she will only get a proper report after her visit to the schools. “Schools are as ready as they could be. The reports I’m getting from all the schools that we’ll be visiting, is [about] the state of readiness, where they still have hitches with placements. I will not be able to give you the full impression about really comparing what I’m being told and what we have observed. But I’m just happy that we are back to school,” adds the minister. Interview with Minister Motshekga:  Meanwhile, in Mpumalanga, the schools that parents had threatened to shutdown have reopened. Earlier this week, some parents of learners at Masihambisane Primary School in Kanyamazane accused the Education Department of failure to deliver mobile classrooms. This was after the department demolished a dilapidated block last year. Some members of the SGB say they have given the department until next Monday to deliver the mobile classrooms.
