Learners and parents at Makgopong village at Zebediela outside Lebowakgomo in Limpopo say they are against the merging of a local school with another due to a shortage of teachers. Mpotla Secondary School was merged with Magwading High School by education authorities, after the death of the school principal and vacant positions for teachers. The School Governing Body (SGB) says despite the merger, scholar transport for learners from the village has not been provided. SGB chairperson Franstens Mothoa says they have made a request to the education department to employ teachers at Mpotla Secondary School. “The scholar transport has not been made available, as parents we asked the department to provide space for our learners at a nearby school since they had already removed grade twelve learners to another school, we requested the education department to hire teachers at our school,” says Mothoa. Officials in Limpopo keep an eye on scholar transport as schools reopen
