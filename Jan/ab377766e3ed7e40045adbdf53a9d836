Police investigating following discovery of five bodies near Eldorado Park:  The issue of cable theft is a huge concern in South Africa. There’s a need for law enforcement agencies to collaborate, especially in countries where stolen cables are sourced from South Africa. This is according to experts who say all players should be targeted as the crime is trans-national and involves a highly structured network. Essential services provided by among others, Eskom and Transnet are disrupted while the looted cables are reportedly exported to countries such as China and India.
