The start of the academic year has been delayed at Mbozisa Junior Secondary School in the Eastern Cape due to damages caused by flooding.  A storm in December left classrooms without roofs, windows and doors. After heavy rains last night, the remaining classrooms that survived the storm were flooded as the roof is leaking. Cleaners had to remove water from the classrooms first before learning could commence. School Governing Body Chairperson, Simon Magwaxaza says the school was already in a bad condition even before it was hit by the devastating storm. “The department of education said they will do something about the school, but nothing has been done thus far, they came to access the situation. We are worried to send children to other schools, other they will close the school,” Simon Magwaxaza explains. Teaching and learning delayed at an Eastern Cape school due to flooding:
