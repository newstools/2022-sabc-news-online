The Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court in Mpumalanga has postponed the case of fraud and corruption against the former Minister of State Security, Bongani Bongo, and eleven co-accused to March 31. This after one of the accused changed legal representative, and the other lawyer failed to appear in court. They were arrested in 2020 in connection with an alleged land deal of R37.5 million dating back to 2011. Apparently, some of the accused received kickbacks after the owners of the farms in question were paid less than the amount that was spent by government. Bongo maintains that he is innocent. “I was hoping today they are going to withdraw because they don’t have a case in as far as I’m concerned. But we are quite disappointed that the case was postponed in May last year for 6 months and then six months later and say it is a postponement till March. There are huge financial implications but also there’s a lot of inconvenience on our side but we will be patient at the end of the day to prove our innocence. I am going to prove my innocence in this case like I proved my innocence in a case in Cape Town.” Full statement from the NPA:  In 2021 Bongo was found not guilty of bribery Former State Security Minister Bongani Bongo has been found not guilty of trying to bribe a Parliamentary Eskom Inquiry Evidence leader by the Western Cape High Court.
