Free State MEC for Education Tate Makgoe says the Matric class of 2021 performance should not be undermined. Makgoe shared the significance of his designer white suit which has now become a center of attraction over the last eight years. Makgoe was wearing his trademark white suit during the province’s top matric achievers celebration event. MEC’s white suit is part of his celebrations:   He has become well known for his dance moves on stage, celebrating what has now become a norm. “The only time that I’ve been able to wear it outside the celebration of matric results has been when my daughter was qualifying with chemical engineering at the University of Western Cape. But under apartheid, for me to go to the University of Cape Town, we had to get a consent letter from the apartheid Minister of Education. And he said no you can’t go to that university, so when my daughter qualified with chemical engineering, because I wanted to do chemical engineering at that university, I felt that I must actually wear this white suit because I’ve revenged against apartheid.” For three consecutive years, the province achieved the top spot for matric results and matric pass rate of 85.7% for the 2021 academic year. It’s an improvement of 0.6%. This is what some of the learners had to say about his white suit. “In my opinion his white suit symbolises peace. So, as the Free State province, we are peacefully fighting this. Many townships are broke, with no opportunities but when it comes to education something white comes up.” “That is why the MEC always wears the white suit when we talk about the results because he knows Free State never disappoints.”
