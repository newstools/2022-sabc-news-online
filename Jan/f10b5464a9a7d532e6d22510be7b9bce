The Ou Kaapse Weg has been re-opened after it was closed due to vegetation fires that broke out on Saturday. The fire was brought under control in the afternoon but roads between Steenberg and Noordhoek remained closed because of heavy smoke. Disaster management in the city had earlier sent out an advisory against starting fires outdoors because of the extremely hot weather conditions that are conducive for the flare-ups of wildfires.

Firefighters are also monitoring a fire in the Paarl Valley. Otto says the fire has been largely contained, but the dense vegetation is still smouldering and causing a lot of smoke. Otto says there are concerns that wind may pick up later in the day.
