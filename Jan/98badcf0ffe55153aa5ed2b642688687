Environmental lobby group the Green Connection has lodged their court papers for an urgent interdict to compel the court to stop an Australian geo-science data company called the Searcher, from continuing its seismic survey off the West Coast in the Western Cape. This comes after the group’s December legal victory over oil giant Shell’s seismic survey in the Wild Coast in the Eastern Cape. They have accused the Department of Minerals and Energy, Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment and the Petroleum Agency SA of failing to consult with affected communities of the West Coast before conducting their seismic survey. Green Connection’s Liziwe Mcdaid says they are fighting to protect the oceans against the greed of oil companies. “The green connection is supporting the west coast fishes in their application to stop the searcher seismic survey, the papers were launched in the High Court {today} and the Green Connection is confident that the papers are strong and the greed of the oil companies will not succeed against the livelihoods of the fishers, and their culture, we need our oceans protected,” says Mcdaid. VIDEO: West Coast communities fight back against seismic survey:   Meanwhile Oil giant Shell is planning to appeal the High Court ruling handed down in Makhanda last month in the Eastern Cape, which halted its seismic survey along the Wild Coast. This after four communities along with several human rights groups won their court action against the oil giant which led to Shell terminating its contract with the ship conducting their seismic, called the Amazon warrior. “Shell is seeking permission to appeal the 28th December judgement along the wild coast survey we are continue to review the best way forward for our licence in the longer term,” Shell Country Chair, Hloniphizwe Mtolo explains.
