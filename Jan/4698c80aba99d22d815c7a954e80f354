Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says he will continue to protect the confidentiality of complainants in the matter involving suspended provincial Community Safety Minister Albert Fritz. Fritz remains on suspension following allegations of serious misconduct. While media reports have circulated that the allegations are linked to sexual assault, Winde has not yet divulged the nature of the allegations. An independent investigation is under way and is expected to be completed in the next 14 days. Winde says he’ll only release details of the complainants once they give him permission to do so. “We’ve got to stand up, we’ve got to say it. We’ve got to enable, but what we must also do at the same time, is offer a caring protective environment. We mustn’t try and hunt down the complainants and try and call them and investigate. They are fragile and they need to be given their space at the same time. So please come out, make as much noise as you can. I sincerely hope that the next time that this happens we see exactly the same thing happen again. Next time maybe it’s in the ANC’s quarter and I hope that they operate exactly the way that they are talking about right now,” says Winde.
