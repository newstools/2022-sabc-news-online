More importantly, Peter was disciplined, and he was a soldier, a warrior and highly disciplined and well steeped in ANC values, culture, traditions and politics.” President Cyril Ramaphosa’s keynote address:  Earlier, Deputy President of the party David Mabuza laid a wreath at the stalwart’s grave in Mankweng. Addressing the party members, Mabuza said the party will remain steadfast in its mission to correct its mistakes.

We will correct ourselves and we will get rid of unwanted elements within our ranks, so we want to say to comrade Peter, we are still here, we are continuing with our struggle, thank you for the contribution that you have made and we have learnt from you.” Mabuza visited the Mokaba family in Mankweng before proceeding to the grave.
