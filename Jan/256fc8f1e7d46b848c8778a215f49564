The Anglican Church says the process of aquamation was used to cremate the body of the late Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. The process consists of cremation by water and chemicals rather than fire. The ashes of the Arch have been interred at St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town in a private family service. Tutu passed away last weekend at the age of 90. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba of Cape Town laid the ashes to rest in front of the high altar of the Cathedral. The service was also attended by several clergies and 20 members of the Tutu family, led by his wife Nomalizo Leah Tutu.  The video below is Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu’s funeral service:
