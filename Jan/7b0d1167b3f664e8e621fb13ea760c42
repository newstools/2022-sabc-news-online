Mozambique President Filipe Nyusi’s PCR results came back negative for COVID-19 after Nyusi and his wife Isaura tested positive via rapid tests days earlier, the President’s office said on Wednesday. Nyusi wrote in a post on his official Facebook page that he would continue to isolate in line with national health protocols “until my wife’s health situation stabilises,” but neither the post nor a statement from Nyusi’s office said what Isaura Nyusi’s PCR test results showed. A spokesperson for Nyusi was not immediately available to elaborate. Mozambique’s coronavirus infections are close to their peak, according to a Reuters tally. The Southern African country has recorded over 2 000 COVID-19-related deaths and 196 000 infections during the pandemic.
