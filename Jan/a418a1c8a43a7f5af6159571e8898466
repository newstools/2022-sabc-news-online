One example of such cooperation from both countries had worked during COVID-19. We have been working together using Israeli methods to empower young women on leadership and self-development.” “On food security, we have been using Israeli plans and technologies to create vegetable gardens in schools. An Israeli NGO and Vision Africa have already connected hundreds of South Africans from rural areas of Limpopo to running water using Israeli technologies and expertise,” Belotsercovky adds.
