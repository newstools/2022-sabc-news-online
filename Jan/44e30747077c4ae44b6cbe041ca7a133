The Presidency says the leaking of a report of the Presidential Economic Advisory Council (PEAC) is a breach of confidentiality and allows for selective quotation from the document that can be taken out of context. President Cyril Ramaphosa has condemned the leaking, saying the report was quoted out of context and was selectively quoted to push a particular narrative. The Presidency on Saturday has confirmed that the report was leaked after it was presented to President Cyril Ramaphosa on the 13th of this month. The Presidency says in a statement that all reports by the PEAC remain confidential until it decides to release them. The PEAC was established to provide the President with a range of expert perspectives on the country’s economic policies. The Presidency says members of the Council hold diverse views and Ramaphosa values the insights that they provide.
