Former Guinean President Alpha Conde, ousted in a coup in September, boarded a plane on Monday to go abroad for a medical check-up, two sources said, without revealing his destination. Last month, the ruling junta said the ex-president would be allowed to travel on medical grounds but could not remain abroad for more than a month. A source close to Conde said he boarded a plane at 2 p.m. (1400 GMT). A top government official confirmed he had left. Conde, 83, who had been in power since 2010, was detained by the junta after his ouster by military officers who accused the government of endemic corruption.
