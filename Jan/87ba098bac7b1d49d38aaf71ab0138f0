The ten suspects arrested in connection with the armed robbery at Malamulele police station are allegedly positively linked to more than one hundred offences in Limpopo. Provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, was speaking following the arrest of the suspects who allegedly attacked the police station and stole cash and firearms in November. Hadebe says they are suspected of various crimes, including ATM bombings, armed robbery, car hijacking, murder and illegal possession of firearms. “For Mopani District is 27 cases, for Vhembe is 17 cases, for Capricorn is 26 cases and their powerhouse was in Sekhukhune with 33 cases. These cases are ranging from different types of cases that were committed. We arrested ten of them and we are still looking at others as associates. So there still more [suspects] outside that we still need to collect [arrest],” adds Hadebe.
