The family of Leigh Matthews seems optimistic that their daughter’s killer Donovan Moodley may not be successful with his parole bid. This was after they made oral representations to the Parole Board on Friday. Moodley wants to be granted parole after serving 15 years of his life sentence. He abducted Matthews from Bond University in 2004, held her captive and demanded ransom money from her family, then killed her. Leigh Matthews’ body was found in Walkerville, south of Johannesburg, in 2004. Her killer is pinning his hopes on parole. A process which the family says has reopened their wounds. SABC News Chriselda Lewis reports:  The family argued before the parole board, among others, that Donovan Moodley refused to be interviewed by an independent clinical psychologist to ascertain whether or not he remains a danger to the community. They say Moodley’s refusal must weigh heavily against his parole bid. Civil society supporting the Matthews family has called for a transparent and fair process. The process is expected to be lengthy and rigorous. A process the Matthews family hopes will not see their daughter’s killer be released. 17 years on… Moodley was convicted of the murder of the 21-year-old in 2005. Leigh’s father Rob Matthews says 17 years later, Moodley is still refraining from telling the truth. “17 years later, Moodley has not changed. He is still the same lying, conniving, deceitful individual. He has different stories of where Leigh was kept. So he is clearly not remorseful. The chairmen of the parole board concluded, and this is all we can say because there is a whole protocol behind it. Whatever their recommendation is, it goes to the minister. The chairman of the parole board concluded by saying, to grant Moodley parole, would be an insult to justice.” Donavan Moodley’s parole hearing concluded: Chriselda Lewis reports  Donovan Moodley parole hearing I Leigh Matthews family make oral representations:
