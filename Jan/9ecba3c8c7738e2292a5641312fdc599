The N3 in KwaZulu-Natal is experiencing high traffic volumes as some holidaymakers head back home after enjoying the festive season celebrations in the province. Law enforcement officers will be increased across major routes as the roads are expecting a number of motorists. N3TC spokesperson, Thania Dhoogra, says traffic is expected to peak from Sunday. “Peak traffic volumes are expected on the route on the 2nd and 3rd of January as many travellers will return home after the festive season break on the N3 toll route volumes may quickly rise and reach 2000 vehicles an hour and this may lead to congestion and slow-moving traffic particularly in the northbound direction towards Gauteng. Motorists are still advised to plan ahead and follow N3TC on Twitter for updates.” 12h00 01/01 #HighTrafficVolumes are expected #JoburgBound towards Gauteng on the #N3TollRoute over the next few days. #LawEnforcement and #EmergencyServices are on the route to help keep #RoadUsers #Safe. #ShareTheRoadResponsibly pic.twitter.com/Com6dKQ7f6 — N3 Toll Concession (@N3Route) January 1, 2022
