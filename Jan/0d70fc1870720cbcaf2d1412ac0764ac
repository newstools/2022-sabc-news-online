The Buffalo City Metro in the Eastern Cape has deployed disaster management teams to areas affected by flash flooding after heavy downpours. Videos on social media show flooded houses and cars. Executive Mayor Xola Pakati is expected to visit the affected areas this afternoon to assess the extent of the damage. Metro spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya has advised people living in low-lying areas to seek alternative accommodation as heavy rainfall is expected for the rest of the weekend. “We are attending to various incidents of floods that have impacted on homes particularly informal settlements and flooded roads. We are undertaking evacuations in NU1 Mdantsane as well as Zone 3 and Zone 18 and teams are on-site in Zone 3 and 18. We are working with ward councillors to provide disaster relief packages and alternative accommodation to the families. Our municipal disaster operations are going to continue throughout the weekend.” A resident in Mdantsane NU 1, Siyavuya Pawuli says they are battling to stay dry. “We woke up this morning and there was water in the house, we tried sweeping it away with a broom and now mopping it and now we put sheets and blankets on the floor to absorb the water cause it keeps filling up.”
