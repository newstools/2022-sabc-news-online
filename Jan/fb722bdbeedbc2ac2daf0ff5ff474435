Hundreds of people in Plettenberg Bay in the Southern Cape have signed a petition, calling for no bail for the alleged murderer of a 36-year-old mother of four. Lyndell Wilderman from New Horizons was severely assaulted by her partner at the weekend and died from her injuries. Police arrested the 57-year-old suspect at the scene. He appeared in the local magistrate’s court twice this week and will appear again in a week’s time for a bail application. “A petition is being circulated throughout Plettenberg Bay to oppose the granting of bail and we appeal to members of all communities to join us on Friday next week in a united stand in court. We do not believe bail is appropriate under these circumstances. Donations of clothing and school necessities would be most welcome to assist the children who ate aged between 2 and 19,” says Janet Harding from The Green Hearts.
