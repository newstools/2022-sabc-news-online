The family of the murdered Elukwatini Police Station commander, Beauty Marivate, says they won’t rest until all those responsible for her murder are arrested. The family was speaking during her memorial service in Nhlazatje,  Mpumalanga. Marivate was shot during a shootout while responding to a business robbery last week. She later died in hospital. Five suspects have been arrested and two are still at large. Family spokesperson, Brian Marivate, says they are devastated. He pleaded with the police to also hunt down and arrest the masterminds providing the criminals with guns. “The people who supply the children with drugs, these are the people they must go because it is useless that we have people die and say it’s statistics. It is not a cop who died, it’s our sister, it’s our grandmother, it’s our lover. My father is devastated, can’t even speak. Let’s stop talking about it, we need action from the politicians.”
