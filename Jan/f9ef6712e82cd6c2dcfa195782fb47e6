Western Cape Police Commissioner Thembisile Patekile has confirmed receipt of a letter from the African National Congress (ANC) in the province, requesting the commissioner to investigate allegations of misconduct that were made against suspended provincial Minister of Community Safety, Albert Fritz. Premier Alan Winde suspended Fritz at the weekend after the allegations came to light. Details regarding the extent and veracity of the allegations that were made against Fritz, have not been confirmed with official sources yet. However, the ANC in the Western Cape says it believes that a police investigation into the matter could result in criminal charges being laid against Fritz. Provincial Police spokesperson Brigadier Novela Potelwa says an inquiry into the matter has since been opened while they await key pertinent documentation before a case is registered. Fritz also stepped aside from his position as DA Leader in the province following the allegations. VIDEO: ANC Western Cape to open criminal case against Albert Fritz:
