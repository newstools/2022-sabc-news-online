The N3 at the Chota Motala offramp in Pietermaritzburg has been re-opened in both directions. This follows community protest action on Thursday morning that forced traffic authorities to divert traffic. At this stage, it is unclear what the protest is about. KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Road Traffic Inspectorate Spokesperson, Zinhle Mngomezulu says the flow of traffic is back to normal. “The road is now opened to traffic there by Chota Motala both bounds are open and there is a backlog of traffic however the flow of traffic itself is back to normal.” #sapsKZN Police are deployed in Pietermaritzburg at Jika Joe informal settlement next to the N3 to restore law and order after #ProtestAction erupted this morning. #PoliceVisibility ME pic.twitter.com/1bNvsmhvPf — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) January 27, 2022
