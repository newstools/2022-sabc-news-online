Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Monday sacked one of his closest allies and State Security Minister Owen Ncube, sighting what he called “conduct inappropriate for a minister of government.” Although no further details were given, speculation is rife that Ncube was fired for instigating post-election violence in the country’s Midlands province and causing disharmony within the ruling Zanu-PF party. Many Zimbabweans are still trying to come to terms with the latest move by the Mnangagwa administration with analysts fearing more expulsions might be coming as the former liberation party tries to bring sanity within its rank and file. As state security minister, Ncube ordered a three-day internet shutdown in January 2019 during nationwide protests against a fuel price hike. Ncube becomes the fourth cabinet minister to be sacked by Mnangagwa. Others include former Environment and tourism Minister Prisca Mupfumira, former energy Minister Fortune and former Health Minister Obadiah Moyo.
