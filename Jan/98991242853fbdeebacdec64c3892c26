African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa has broken his silence on what led to his premature departure from the ANC Women’s League event at Lebowakgomo Civic Centre in Limpopo on Thursday. He left the centre just before delivering the Lillian Ngoyi Memorial Lecture, citing a lack of COVID-19 protocols. Ramaphosa has just told the SABC News in Mokgopong that there was nothing sinister about his departure. He says there was a mutual agreement between him and the league that the event could not continue without observing COVID-19 protocols. “Everybody agreed including the Women’s league that we hadn’t complied with the COVID-19 regulations. So, everything was well handled and I’m glad everybody, including the leadership agreed that we should not proceed,” Ramaphosa explains.
