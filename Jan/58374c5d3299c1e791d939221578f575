Deputy principal Thembisile Ngendane has been described as an educator who went the extra mile, often working long hours in the service of education at the Phomolong Secondary School in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga and MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school on Tuesday morning. This after Ngendane was gunned down outside the school on Friday, allegedly by learners. The killers did not take anything from the educator or her car. Motshekga says the education fraternity is devastated by the death of 50-year-old Ngendane who dedicated her life to her learners. “I visited this school during COVID-19 and I interacted with her. I was quite impressed with how teachers were responded and what teachers were doing creatively. I just felt, what a painful experience for a teacher. This is a very good school, they perform well, these teachers work hard. This teacher was working until late, sorting out administration issues when everybody was gone, she was still left here. She had just bought a young girl a uniform with her own money. She was that kind of teacher who went out of her way.” In the video tweet below, Motshekga says she hopes the culprits behind the murder will be found soon: [WATCH]: @DBE_SA Minister Angie Motshekga addressed the school community of Phomolong Secondary School in Tembisa today and expressed her undying support for the school through the challenges they are facing. | @Lesufi @ElijahMhlanga pic.twitter.com/k18xP9sdHA — Gauteng Department of Education (@EducationGP1) January 25, 2022
