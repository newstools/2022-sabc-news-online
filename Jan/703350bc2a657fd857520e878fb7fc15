The trial of the four police officers accused of fatally shooting Mthokozisi Ntumba during the Fees Must Fall protest, in March 2021, has resumed in the High Court in Johannesburg on Thursday morning. The officers, Tshepiso Kekana, Motseothata Boitumelo, Madimeja Lekgodi and Victor Nkosinathi Mohammed are facing four charges including murder. 35-year-old Ntumba was allegedly killed by the police who opened fire on a group of students outside a TVET college in Braamfontein, Johannesburg.. On Wednesday, IPID investigator Judy Twala told the High Court how police drove off after Ntumba was shot. She also testified that the officers hadn’t recorded the incident when it occurred. However, the officer’s attorneys disputed Twala’s evidence that their clients did not report the incident. There were also claims by defence lawyers that evidence at the scene could have been tampered with.

I saw his photo. He was working for the Department of Human Settlements and has just gained his Master’s degree. He’s a father of three, he’s got a young wife. I think his youngest son is just a year old. It’s a sad issue,” said the Minister. “It’s a sad situation to look at. It’s something that you can’t really even be able to live with as a human being now, taking all other elements of life out,” says Cele.
