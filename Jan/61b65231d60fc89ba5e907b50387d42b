The South African Medical Association (SAMA) believes that South Africa will experience a slight surge in COVID-19 infections in the coming weeks as the festive season draws to an end. More than 8 000 new cases were recorded in the latest reporting cycle representing a 20.1 percent positivity rate. After a significant drop over the festive season, it appears as if the number of new OVID-19 cases is rising again. SAMA Chairperson Dr Angelique Coetzee says they also expect the reopening of schools to contribute to the rise in infections in the next few weeks. Coetzee says, “I think we will see a slight surge, not a very big one, especially in a week or two after the schools start, then I think it will come down again.” “A lot of people has been infected with omicron without them even knowing and people who I have seen in my own surgery that they don’t tend to go and test that easily anymore, they just accept that it may be COVID-19 and I’m getting better and I’m not going to get tested. We just need to see what the next week or two is going to bring into the numbers game,” adds Coetzee. In the podcast below, Dr Coetzee explains further:
