Convicted killer Muzi Malepane says he was angry that it was Ntutuko Shoba that told police about CCTV footage after he was arrested. Malepane was arrested on 15 June 2020, a few days after killing Tshegofatso Pule. Malepane says he was hired by Shoba to kill Tshegofatso Pule. Shoba is currently on trial facing charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and defeating the ends of justice. Tshegofatso Pule’s funeral service: State witness Malepane has told the court that he did not tell the police the entire truth around Pule’s murder when he made a statement after his arrest. He said he confessed to the murder, pointed out the crime scene, and concealed Shoba’s involvement. This was up until he heard from the police that the evidence retrieved from CCTV footage, when he picked up Pule, was information provided by Shoba. He says he was angered by the betrayal hence decided to tell the whole truth claiming Shoba was the mastermind behind the murder. Malepane has also been questioned about threats he made to Shoba while in prison saying he will unleash the 26 and 28 gangs to sexually assault him. But he says it was just talking and nothing more.
