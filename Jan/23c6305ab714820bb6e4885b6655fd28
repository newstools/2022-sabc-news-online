The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs in the North West says 72 households and 50 chalets have been evacuated in Bloemhof. This is as the Water and Sanitation Department released more water from the Vaal and Bloemhof dams, in an effort to reduce the water levels following heavy rainfall. The downstream levels were rising rapidly and led to fear of possible flooding. Houses on the bank of the Vaal River have been submerged:  The spokesperson for the department Dineo Thapelo says all emergency services are on high alert. Meanwhile, Department and Water and Sanitation spokesperson Sputnik Ratau says the opening of the five sluice gates is to manage and protect infrastructure. “The Vaal Dam continues to rise due to the inflows that it is receiving as a result of the recent rains. We are seeing a lot of activity on the Vaal, Orange River system, and therefore we will continue to inform communities as to how things are being affected. We are seeing a lot of activity in the rivers as well as toward the confluence at Douglas in the Northern Cape.”
