The Limpopo Health Department says a lack of permanent managers at some of its facilities is not affecting the delivery of basic services. Some community members have expressed concerns about a lack of managers at some hospitals in the province saying it affects service delivery. Department Spokesperson, Neil Shikwambana says the acting managers are in the meantime ensuring the smooth running of hospitals. Shikwambana says, “Facilities where we currently do not have managers, where we have got acting managers, it does not necessarily mean that becomes a permanent arrangement it’s a temporary arrangement between a time when a person resign or passes on or move due to any other reasons and the time of appointing a new manager,” says Shikwambana.
