Western Cape Community Safety Minister, Albert Fritz, has been suspended with immediate effect following allegations of misconduct. Premier Alan Winde says serious allegations were made against Fritz the last week. It is unclear whether the allegations are related to his office or to matters outside of his official office. Winde says he has initiated a full investigation into the matter. Fritz has offered his full cooperation on the matter. Meanwhile, the African National Congress in the Western Cape has called on Winde to provide reasons for suspending Fritz. Leader of the opposition in the legislature, Cameron Dugmore says, “Were these reasons about personal conduct? Were they about issues connected to his role as the MEC? The public has the right to know and we as the ANC in the Western Cape Legislature are insisting that the Premier come clean with the legislature and the Western Cape community as a whole and give us the reasons for this sudden suspension. We want to know and the public deserves to know.” Below is the ANC statement reacting to Fritz’s suspension:
