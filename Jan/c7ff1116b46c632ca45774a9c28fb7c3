Terrorism and violent extremism will top the agenda at the SADC extraordinary summit of heads of state to review progress of the SADC mission in Mozambique. The meeting will take place in Malawi from Tuesday. Mozambique has been battling insurgency in the northern part of the country. SADC leaders will review progress of its mission in Mozambique’s troubled region of Cabo Delgado. The mission is currently deployed in that area to combat terrorism and acts of violent extremism. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who heads the SADC organ on Defence, Politics and Security Cooperation will participate in two summits of the regional bloc in Malawi. “SADC Troika, which I chair, is going to meet in Malawi. We are going to look at the progress and developments in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique and thereafter, we will have SADC Summit to evaluate and it’s a straight forward meeting.” Since its deployment, the mission has recaptured villages, unseated terrorists from their bases and seized weapons as well. SADC says the military intervention is vital to pacify the region and ensure that law and order is restored in northern Mozambique. Recently, the extraordinary summit of the SADC troika approved the extension of the mission. Liesl Louw Vaudran, ISS Researcher says, “This shows to what extent this deployment in Mozambique is important for SADC and it’s a strategic situation and it’s better that it’s going to be face to face. They will look at the funding and strengthening the mission, and its mandate expires on the 15th January.” Mozambican authorities say the terrorist attacks have undermined the rights of citizens. Some of the troops contributing countries include Angola, Botswana, DRC, Lesotho, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia.
