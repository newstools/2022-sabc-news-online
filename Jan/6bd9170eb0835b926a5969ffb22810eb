Family spokesperson Zamile Matuwane says they are considering taking legal action against those who they say are spreading false information that he was a spy. “The family Matiwane and Mafe are going to take serious steps in connection with the story. Daily Maverick has written in the newspaper because as a family we are not aware of any military training Zandile undertook.” Mystery around Parliament fire accused deepens: After his court appearance last week, Mafe’s lawyer said his client plans on pleading not guilty. Mafe is facing charges of destruction of essential infrastructure, the possession of an explosive device, arson, theft and housebreaking. Mafe’s bail application was been postponed to Tuesday for the court to verify his information. His lawyer, Luvuyo Godla, spoke to the media outside the court. “He was arrested by members of SAPS and one will assume maybe he must have been arrested within a certain proximity of the incident which in this case, it could even be Khayelitsha, where all of us, reside because it’s 20 minutes to Khayelitsha. So all those issues will be issues that will be ventilated. He denies vehemently those charges, he rejects those charges.”
