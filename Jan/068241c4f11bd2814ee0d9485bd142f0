As the African National Congress (ANC) prepares for the January 8 Statement celebrations in Polokwane, Limpopo – we look at the themes the party has presented from 2012 to 2021. Founded on 8 January 1912 by John Langalibalele Dube in Bloemfontein as the South African Native National Congress (SANNC), the primary focus for the organisation was to bring Africans together as one. The first January 8 Statement was delivered in exile by OR Tambo in 1972, however since the party had been banned in South Africa it would only release their next statement in 1979 which was dubbed the year of the spear. The delivery of the January 8 Statement would become a lifelong practice for the party after the year of the spear, celebrating its founding and presenting the focus theme for the coming year. ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver his fifth January 8 Statement at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane. THEMES: ANC January 8 Statement
