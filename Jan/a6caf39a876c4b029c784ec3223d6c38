The African National Congress (ANC) was founded on 8 January 1912 and for many years the occasion of this anniversary was marked with the release by the National Executive Committee (NEC) of a major statement for the forthcoming year. The ANC has called on all citizens of the country to continue to show support, as the party celebrates its 110th birthday this week. The party says there will be strict adherence to COVID-19 safety regulations at the celebrations to be held at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, Limpopo on Saturday. Party President, Cyril Ramaphosa, is expected to deliver the party’s annual January 8th statement at the rally.
