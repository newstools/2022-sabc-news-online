The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) has reassured the public that the situation at the Waterkloof Airforce Base in Pretoria is under control. Investigations are continuing to determine what could have caused Sunday’s fire. Officials say a pipe burst at the bulk fuel area within the base. Although foul play has not been ruled out, senior officials say the base is well-secured. SANDF Spokesperson  Brigadier-General Andries Mahapa says, “We don’t have any element of doubt when it comes to regular maintenance as it has been done. Last night(Sunday), the chief fireman said the investigation is ongoing. They do the inspection and maintenance on a daily basis, so it is nothing that one should be really worried about due to a lack of maintenance.” “There are so many theories about this issue. Some are linking it to the Parliament, some are linking it to the courts, but this is a separate issue altogether. It is just a fire that broke out and we managed to contain it, so everything is under control,” says Mahapa. Waterkloof Fire I SANDF investigating the cause of fire at the airforce base in Pretoria:
