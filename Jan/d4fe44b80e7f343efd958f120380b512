The murder trial of the four police officers accused of fatally shooting Mthokozisi Ntumba during the #FeesMustFall protest in March last year, is expected to resume on Monday morning in the High Court in Johannesburg. The officers, Tshepiso Kekana, Motseothata Boitumelo, Madimeja Lekgodi and Victor Nkosinathi Mohammed are facing four charges including murder. Thirty-five-year-old, Ntumba was killed allegedly by the police officers who opened fire on a group of students outside a TVET college in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. Last week, Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) investigator Judy Twala told the High Court how police drove off after Ntumba was shot. She also testified that the officers hadn’t recorded the incident when it occurred. However, the officer’s attorneys disputed Twala’s evidence that their clients did not report the incident. There were also claims by defence lawyers that evidence at the scene could have been tampered with. In the video below, Colonel Jacob Beeslaar was cross-questioned on Friday: In 2021, Police Minister Bheki Cele spoke to the media after visiting Ntumba’s family home in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg. “He’s a young man. I saw his photo. He was working for the Department of Human Settlements and has just gained his Master’s degree. He’s a father of three, he’s got a young wife. I think his youngest son is just a year old. It’s a sad issue,” said Cele. “It’s a sad situation to look at. It’s something that you can’t really even be able to live with as a human being now, taking all other elements of life out,” he added.
