Former Free State MEC for police, roads and transport Butana Komphela will be buried in his home town of Kroonstad in the Free State on Sunday. Komphela died in hospital in Bloemfontein on Monday where he had been treated for a month. The ANC in the province says he will be remembered for touching the lives of many citizens and his uncompromising stand to see the lives of the struggling masses changing for the better. Komphela also served in the Free State Executive as MEC for Health and Social Development. Before that he was the chairperson of Parliament’s portfolio committee in sport. Earlier, ANC Interim Provincial Committee spokesperson, Oupa Khoabane said Komphela left a legacy that would be a challenge for younger generation to emulate. “As the ANC, we are devastated because this is the person who was bringing the necessary energy in the ANC and the ideas that he was bringing was the idea that were taking the ANC forward but especially in the fight to change the lives of the people. We are encouraging members of the ANC especially the young ones to take up where he left off. And ensure that we change the lives of the people for the better.”
