A mother of a six-year-old girl from Kimberley in the Northern Cape, who was raped allegedly by a 14-year-old boy, says the justice system has failed them. This as the case against the boy was withdrawn after his psychological evaluation deemed him unfit to be held criminally liable. It’s alleged that the teenage boy lured the young girl to a nearby veld where he then raped her. The mother of the six-year-old rape survivor says all she wanted was justice. “It is sad. Because my child is not the same anymore. The alleged perpetrator is roaming the streets and my child sees him all the time and gets scared when she does. She is not safe yet he is free,” says the victim’s mother. She says her daughter is still traumatised by the incident. “She is struggling to concentrate in school and now she even failed the year. This has affected her, we even have to visit psychologists monthly,” the victim’s mother adds. The fourteen-year-old alleged perpetrator was briefly incarcerated following the rape last year. “The case was laid before the prosecution which requested that this boy be sent for psychological evaluation. The psychologist reported that the boy has a mental capacity of a nine-year-old and has no criminal capacity. On the basis of the report the prosecution declined to prosecute the case,” says Northern Cape SAPS Spokesperson, Bashoabile Kale. The family insists that they will not let this matter go and is seeking legal assistance to ensure justice is served.
