The Gauteng Department of Education says that it has made inroads in finding space at schools for learners who were not placed when schools in the province started on Wednesday. Spokesperson Steve Mabona, says that they’ve managed to reduce the number of unplaced learners from 700 down to just under 300. Mabona says the placement process should be completed by the end of the month. “We have already opened the system for late applicants to access the system and to schools. So, that’s what we’re doing now, and we’re hopeful that by the end of January, we should be in a position to say we’re done with the process of admissions. And our district offices are full with quite a number of people that are saying they seek space, coming from different provinces,” says Mabona.
