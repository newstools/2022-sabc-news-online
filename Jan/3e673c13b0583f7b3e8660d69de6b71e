Chief Executive Officer of the Tourism Business Council of South Africa (TBCSA), Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa says they have embarked on an advocacy programme in a bid to start to promote the country again as an attractive tourist destination. It is evident that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the tourism industry in South Africa and the rest of Africa. This is mainly due to lockdown regulations and travel restrictions that were imposed. Tshivhengwa says the programme will seek to change the mindset of tourists on aspects such as safety. “So there is a programme that we have embarked on in developing South African tourism, making sure that the trade partners in the source markets put us back in their brochures,” says Tshivhengwa. ‘We need to build demand in markets so that tourists could come back to South Africa. So, it’s gonna be a long road ahead. It will include a brand-building exercise with the trade partners in the source markets. And also participating in many, many, you know various exhibitions across the world,” says Tshivhengwa.
