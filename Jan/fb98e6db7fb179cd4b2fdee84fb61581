Opposition parties in the Western Cape Provincial Legislature have raised objections to what they say are plans by Premier Alan Winde to appoint former Provincial Transport Minister, Bonginkosi Madikizela as his Special Advisor. This follows the retirement of the previous incumbent, Donald Grant, in November last year. Both the African National Congress (ANC) and GOOD Party have accused Winde of contempt for ethical values, saying this illustrated how the Democratic Alliance (DA) exercises double standards. They say Madikizela who was also DA provincial leader, resigned from all positions after he was caught lying about his academic qualifications. Winde however, says the appointment has not yet been finalised and is awaiting vetting. GOOD Party leader, Brett Herron says Madikizela was caught lying about his qualifications. “He was caught lying about his qualifications and caught lying to parliament, found to have breached the Executive Code of Ethics by the Public Protector, and resigned as the MEC in disgrace after the premier had suspended him. Now he has to return to the provincial government with a soft landing appointment.”
