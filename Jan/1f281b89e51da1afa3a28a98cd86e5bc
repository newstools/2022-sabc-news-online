The bail application of the 49-year-old man implicated in the burning of Parliament has been postponed to Tuesday next week by the Cape Town Magistrates’ Court. Chris Mafe was arrested in connection with Sunday’s fire at Parliament which destroyed offices and led to the collapse of some ceilings. The Hawks say the suspect will be charged under the National Key Point Act. Western Cape National Prosecuting Authority Spokesperson, Eric Ntabazalila, says the accused has a case to answer. “Us as the State, we want to charge him on Schedule 5 because we feel that as part of the destruction especially that section that deals with essential infrastructure which is a key point. In fact, the policy allows us to charge him under Schedule 5. The defence wants him to be charged under schedule one. There is a case for him to answer. He was arrested and he was charged with all those five serious counts.” Police have since charged a 49-year-old man with arson and other offences including theft. National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said the arson, if confirmed, would represent an attack on the country’s democracy. Man accused of Parliament fire appears in court:  Mop up operations Meanwhile, Parliament says it is good news that the fire that gutted the National Assembly Building has now been contained completely. However, the roof of the Assembly has been destroyed completely. Mopping up operations are now under way. This as the fire was stopped around midnight after it re-ignited yesterday afternoon.
