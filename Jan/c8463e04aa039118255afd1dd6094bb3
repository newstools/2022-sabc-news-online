Amazon.com Inc has filed a legal challenge at an Indian tribunal against the national antitrust agency’s supension of a 2019 deal it had with Indian retailer Future Group, two sources with direct knowledge told Reuters on Sunday. India’s antitrust agency suspended its approval of Amazon.com’s 2019 deal with Future Group last month, potentially denting the U.S. e-commerce giant’s attempts to block the sale of Future’s retail assets to an Indian market leader. Amazon has long argued that Future violated the terms of its 2019 deal in deciding to sell retail assets to market leader Reliance Industries , and the U.S. company’s position had so far been backed by the Singapore arbitrator and Indian courts. Future denies any wrongdoing. Amazon filed an appeal against CCI’s decision at India’s National Company Law Appellate Tribunal late on Saturday night, the two sources said. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The CCI also did not respond.
