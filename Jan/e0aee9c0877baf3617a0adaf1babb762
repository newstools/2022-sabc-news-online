The Competition Tribunal will from Monday hear argument in a virtual sitting regarding the Competition Commission’s pursuit of administrative penalties for alleged price fixing against tyre manufacturers Continental, Goodyear and the Tyre Manufacturers Conference. The price fixing allegedly occurred from 1999 to 2007. It was allegedly done through the Manufacturers Conference. The Tribunal says in a statement that the matter emanates from a price fixing complaint lodged by Parsons Transport with the Commission. The commission concluded that the tyre manufacturers’ conduct contravened sections of the Competition Act. Manufacturer Bridgestone was granted conditional immunity from prosecution. Apollo settled with the Commission in December 2011 and paid an administrative penalty of R45 million.
