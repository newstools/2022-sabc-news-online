Malema has encouraged members to act in the best interest of the people and the organisation. “Unity of the EFF in KwaZulu-Natal and everywhere in South Africa is important. Do not over exaggerate your individual self-importance, always put the EFF first. When you’re about to act ask yourself a simple question: Is this in the best interest of the organisation? If the answer is no, walk away from that idea. If it is not revolutionary, it will not help the poor.” https://t.co/0igM72x0QL — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) January 8, 2022  EFF celebrations at Durban’s People’s Park:  Malema has told party councillors to hit the ground running and work hard. He says councillors must remember they are there to serve the people. “Don’t go into the council there and become sweethearts to the Mayor and the Municipal Manager. I want EFF councillors who are going to disrupt the council and when they say why, you’ll say the Inanda people want sanitation, water and electricity including houses for free.”
