“Rabies has always been a problem in KZN unfortunately, due to COVID-19 and everything that has gone along with it, people have not been able to necessarily vaccinate their pets against rabies as a result of that we are seeing a much higher number of cases coming into our SPCA obviously, to other organisation’s. Here at our SPCA we normally dealing with about three or four potential rabies cases on our weekly basis, confirmed cases are anything between one, two or three on average per week which is very high for us. Then the concern is that we have is that is not difficult to have rabies vaccination and the most important is if anybody comes to contact with the rabies case, they themselves go get treatment immediately, there is no cure for rabies. Rabies kills.”
