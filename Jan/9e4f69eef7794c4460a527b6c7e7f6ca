The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has appealed to the LFC Milling Company in Wesselsbron, Free State, to resolve concerns raised by workers. Over 80 workers have been on strike since June 2021. Racism, lack of equality and salary increment are some of the critical issues raised. Workers led by the National Emancipated and Allied Workers Union of South Africa (NEAWUSA) say they have marched several times with no success. In the video below, NEAWUSA marches against alleged discrimination of Black workers:  ‘Discrimination’ Seven months without salaries, the workers say they are fighting for equal rights at their workplace. They accuse the company of discrimination and victimisation. Workers say black workers are paid less than their white counterparts despite doing the same job. One worker says, “The employer is just so stubborn, selfish and self-centered. A white old man who doesn’t care about the black lives since last year. He has been saying that he is the owner and he can shut down the company and take his money.” “I want to see the employer answering us so that we know where we stand. For seven months, it has been difficult at our homes. Everything is collapsing. It is even difficult to register our children at school,” laments another worker. The EFF says there is tension within the community. While workers are on strike, the company has allegedly employed others in their positions. Free State EFF Deputy Chairperson Mahlomola Majake says, “It now spills into the community. The community is now fighting amongst itself. We are about to black-on-black violence that’s we are intervening. So we are pleading with this company to resolve this issue, failing which we will come.” LFC Milling Company declined to comment. EFF has given the company seven days to respond.
