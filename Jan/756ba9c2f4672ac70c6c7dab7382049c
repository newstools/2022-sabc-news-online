Apple also teased its metaverse ambitions as Chief Executive Tim Cook talked of the company investing in the expansion of its library of 14,000 augmented reality apps, prompting strong investor response. read more At least 11 brokerages raised their price targets for the stock, bringing the median price target to $188.5, according to Refinitiv data.
