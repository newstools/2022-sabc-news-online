Nine people have died in two separate head-on collisions on the N1 in Limpopo in the past 24 hours. Six people were killed on the N1 north near the Capricorn Plaza when a sedan collided with a Department of Health patients transport minibus. The deceased include both drivers and four passengers. Three others were killed on the N1 outside Mookgophong when two vehicles also collided head-on. Traffic authorities attribute the collisions to possible reckless and negligent driving. Both collisions happened after unsafe over-taking by the drivers, thus causing head-on collisions. On the N1 south outside Mookgophong, one of the vehicles caught fire after the collision. The authorities appeal to the drivers to be cautious and follow the road rules.
