The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) has called on the Department of Trade and Industry to engage with the Competition Commission over a long-running dispute with the management of dairy company, Clover. Members of SAFTU, the Food and Allied Workers Union (FAWU) and the General Industries Workers’ Union (GIWUSA) are threatening to occupy the Union Buildings if their demands are not met. Workers have been on strike for almost three months in efforts to stop job losses at Clover.
