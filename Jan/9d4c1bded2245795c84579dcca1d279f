Commuters have mixed feelings as new rail services opened on Monday on the Mabopane-Pretoria line. Wide-scale vandalism before and after the level 5 lockdown in 2020 forced the shutdown of the Mabopane Rail Corridor. Prasa resumed services after the Rail Safety Regulator gave them the thumbs up to run a full train service along this corridor, now new Electric Multiple Unit Trains are being used. However, the train was an hour late, leaving some commuters frustrated. Nine months after services were suspended on the Pretoria to Mabopane corridor, the line has been re-opened as SABC News’ Ofentse Setimo reports on what is happening at Mabopane station:  Train stations across the country were left vulnerable when Prasa failed to renew a security contract in 2019. It subsequently resulted in vandalism and theft of infrastructure before and during the 2020 lockdown. Vendors at the station have appealed to officials to avert a repeat of what transpired.   Treasury has allocated 900 million Rand for securing Prasa’s infrastructure nationally. It will include technology and manpower.
