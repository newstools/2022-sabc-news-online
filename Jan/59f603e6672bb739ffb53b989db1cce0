The South African Municipal Workers Union (SAMWU) second deputy president Portia Nkuna has described the late two union leaders in Vhembe, Limpopo, as champions of whistleblowing against corruption. Timson Musetsho and Ronald Mani were shot and killed in Thohoyandou three years ago. Musetsho and Mani were killed allegedly for being outspoken about the Vhembe District Municipality investing public funds in the VBS Mutual Bank. The municipality has lost over R300 million in the defunct bank. Nkuna says the VBS saga has affected the whole country. She was speaking during their memorial service in Thohoyandou. “We are here to celebrate and commemorate the lives and times of comrade TT and comrade Mani who crucified here at Vhembe district. The issue of VBS did not affect only in Vhembe district, it affected the entire country. Comrade TT and comrade Mani fought a good fight against corruption by blowing a whistle and subsequent to that followed by their killers one by one,” says Nkuna. The Musetsho and Mani families say they want justice to take its course against the four accused persons so that they can get closure. Nelson Rakhadani and Hulisani Mani say their deceased relatives fought against corruption. “If we continue to have the memorial lecture and the case is not closed it hurt us,” says Rakhadani,” “The only crime that he committed was to be selfless, he died because he was speaking for the voiceless workers because he was confronting corruption,” says Mani.
