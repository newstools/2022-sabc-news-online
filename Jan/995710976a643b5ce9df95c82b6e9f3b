Democratic Alliance (DA) leader John Steenhuisen says the party will be first in line to lay criminal charges against its suspended Western Cape Community Safety MEC Albert Fritz. The only details the DA has released is that there are serious allegations against Fritz related to his conduct. Premier Alan Winde suspended Fritz during the weekend, following the allegations. He has also stepped aside from his position as DA leader in the province. MEC Albert Fritz has stepped aside from his position until the end of February as investigations continue: Winde has announced that Advocate Jennifer Williams from the state attorney’s office will lead the investigation. Speaking in Durban, Steenhuisen said if Fritz is found guilty, he will be expelled from the DA. The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has meanwhile written to the Provincial Police Commissioner, to request him to investigate whether allegations of misconduct that have been made against Fritz can lead to criminal charges. Four officials from the Department of Community Safety, who were also implicated in the allegations, have also been placed on precautionary leave.
