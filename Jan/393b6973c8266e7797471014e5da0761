African National Congress national chairperson Gwede Mantashe has reiterated that the Zondo Commission’s State Capture report should not be used to fight factional battles within the party. He was speaking at the funeral service of Emalahleni Executive Mayor Linah Malatjie and her husband Sepetlele at the Puma stadium in Mpumalanga. The couple died in a car crash between KwaMhlanga and Emalahleni last Sunday. Mantashe says if not properly managed, the Zondo Commission report will affect the party negatively. He also emphasized the importance of fighting corruption and doing away with factions. “That report is going to say many things about many of us, we must not use that report as an axe to chop one another, if we want that report to any value to the ANC we must use it to identify weaknesses and mistakes we have committed and use that report as a tool to rebuild the ANC.” State Capture Report | Calls for speedy prosecution of those implicated Part One of State Capture Report Below:
