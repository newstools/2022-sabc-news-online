The Presidency has issued a new statement saying it stands by its earlier communication regarding a discussion between President Cyril Ramaphosa and Minister of Tourism Lindiwe Sisulu and has nothing more to add. PRESIDENCY STANDS BY STATEMENT ON MINISTER OF TOURISM The Presidency stands by its statement earlier this evening, 20 January 2022, on a discussion between President @CyrilRamaphosa and Minister of Tourism Ms Lindiwe Sisulu. — Presidency | South Africa  (@PresidencyZA) January 20, 2022  In the earlier statement, the Presidency said Sisulu had retracted her comments relating to the country’s judiciary and apologised for the hurt she had caused. The Presidency said Sisulu had accepted that her comments accusing African judges of being “mentally colonised” were hurtful, unsubstantiated and gratuitous and she affirmed her support for the judiciary. However, Sisulu issued her own statement disowning the earlier message from the Presidency,  affirming that the Presidency statement was a misrepresentation of the meeting she had with President Cyril Ramaphosa. Sisulu said she would issue a full statement in 24 hours.
