These families are heart broken and in tears. The little bit of clothing and food they were able to save are full of mud and not of use. They have lost everything. Gift of the Givers is on the ground to assess the situation as the list of affected families is slowly increasing. The immediate need is shelter, food, blankets, mattresses and clothing which our team will be distributing.”
