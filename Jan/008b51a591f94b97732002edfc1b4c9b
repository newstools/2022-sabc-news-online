Phaahla warned that despite a noted decrease in COVID-19 related deaths, the Omicron variant is highly transmissible. He was speaking during a virtual media briefing on government’s efforts to fight the pandemic. “Gauteng province has officially exited the fourth wave this week and all other provinces have reached their peaks, the other 8 provinces, and are now on a decline. Of note is the fact that the decline in new infections is not a steep decline as was the incline. So this virus rises steeply but it goes down slowly. But at least it is going down and that is encouraging.”
