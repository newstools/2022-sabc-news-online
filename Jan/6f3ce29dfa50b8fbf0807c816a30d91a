National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has urged the police to ensure the safety of the Cape Town City Hall. The hall will be the venue of the State of the Nation Address by President Cyril Ramaphosa next week. The City of Cape Town offered the city hall to Parliament following a fire that gutted the National Assembly earlier this month. While she expressed confidence in the police, Mapisa-Nqakula urged Police Minister Bheki Cele, at a ceremony to hand the city hall over to the Presiding officers, that he should make sure that the facility is secured. “As the mayor hands over this city hall to us today, we know that from now onwards you have a task to ensure that this Parliament of the people which is here on the GP is well looked after, it is well safeguarded. Over the weekend we saw what happened to a city hall in an area called Komani now, which was engulfed by fire and went up in flames,” says  Mapisa-Nqakula.
