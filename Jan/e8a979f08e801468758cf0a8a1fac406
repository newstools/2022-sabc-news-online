The Democratic Alliance (DA) has called for an independent forensic investigation into the fire that has destroyed the buildings of Parliament. Chief Whip Natasha Mazzone says the police themselves cannot investigate the incident. The DA held a media briefing following the fire that has now destroyed the entire National Assembly building and part of the Old Assembly building. Mazzone says they will insist at the meeting of the Chief Whips Forum that independent investigators work alongside police forensic investigators. “We have seen forensic investigators on the precinct this (Tuesday) morning. But we do believe that an independent forensic investigation is needed. From the damage and the devastation that we can see and the damage and devastation that we cannot see and the last statement by the Speaker, it looks like something more sinister than simply a homeless man jumping the fence and starting a fire on the third floor. It is looking like something more sinister going on and we will get to the bottom of it believe you me.” Parliament Fire | DA leader John Steenhuisen makes a statement:  Meanwhile, the DA says it will support efforts to ensure that the fire that broke out on Sunday does not interrupt Parliament’s work. The party says this is the only way to ensure that those who want to derail the country’s democracy do not succeed. Speaking at a media briefing in Cape Town, DA leader John Steenhuisen said all resources should be used to ensure that the work of Parliament continues. “If this is, as some are suggesting, an assault on our democracy, then the very best reaction will be to ensure that democracy does not stop doing its work. And so the focus has got to be how we get Parliament business back and running as seamlessly as possible because that’s how you deal with people who try and disrupt democracy, that’s how you deal with adversity. You get right back again and you get back to work.”
