The process of identifying the remains of the 17 people who died in Limpopo in Tuesday night’s collision between a minibus taxi and another vehicle will start on Thursday. Most of the victims were burned beyond recognition after the minibus taxi burst into flames following the collision on the N1 near Mookgopong. Family members will submit DNA samples at the Mokopane hospital this morning and meet with investigating officers who are expected to release a full report about the collision. Preliminary investigations revealed that the vehicle had a tyre burst which caused it to veer into the oncoming traffic, colliding with the minibus taxi. The names of the passengers of the mini-bus taxi that have been confirmed are now known, through a list which was captured when the initial taxi they boarded left the Pretoria Bosman Street station. Seven people survived the crash while two others are still recovering in hospital. The driver of the other vehicle died on the scene. MEC for Transport Mavhungu-Lerule Ramakhanya and Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba will meet with the families at Mokopane Hospital.
