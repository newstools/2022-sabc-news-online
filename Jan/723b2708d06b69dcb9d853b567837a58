Parents and learners of the Tirelong Secondary School near Kroondal in the North West have marched to the N4 saying they will blockade the road until the Education Department provides learners with mobile classrooms. The school was badly vandalised over the December holidays and the department made alternative arrangements for learners which would see them attending three farm schools in the area. On Wednesday morning, only grade 12 learners went to school while those in the lower grades did not report for school. Earlier, parents expressed their apprehension about their children attending three farm schools in the area. Tirelong Secondary School, which consist of 430 learners from Grade 8 to 12, was built and donated by Kroondal Platinum Mine in 2010. Over the last two years, the school has been a target of vandalism. During the December holidays, it was targeted again and roofs, window panes, taps and all electronic equipment were taken. The school currently has no running water or electricity and the provincial education department was forced to intervene. Learners and 32 educators are to be temporarily accommodated at three of the nearby farm schools. One such school is Moedwil combined school, which is about 45 kilometres away from Kroondal. Pupils express how they feel about the new arrangement:   #WATCH Learners at Tirelong Secondary school near Rustenburg in the North West have taken their frustrations to the streets as their school remains closed after it was vandalized.
