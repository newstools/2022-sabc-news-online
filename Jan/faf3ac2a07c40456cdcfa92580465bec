The Buffalo City Metro in the Eastern Cape has come under heavy criticism after it issued a notice to residents that they need to apply to the municipality to install water tanks for rainwater harvesting. Residents are fuming, demanding that the notice be scrapped. There is provision for the Metro to issue such a notice under section 52 of its Water Services by-law. The Metro is defending its decision about the notice and urges residents to comply. Municipal spokesperson Samkelo Ngwenya says there is no ulterior motive. “We think people need to calm down, this is a standard procedure. There is no intention by the municipality to charge for water tanks but due to the drought situation every household installing a water tank and that is interfering with our systems, contaminating our water supply and we want to send our inspectors into each and every house that has got a water tank so that we guide the process.” The residents are questioning the motive. “People already cannot pay their accounts because of the extremely high charges. We don’t understand how the municipality wishes to provide a service with regards to rainwater that is people’s own investment on their property.” “We are already paying exorbitant rates, the ratepayers we are sick and tired of being ripped off, they look for any excuse to make money.”
