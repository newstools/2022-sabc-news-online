A Limpopo man accused of stabbing and injuring two homeless people in a city park in Pretoria three years ago, has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder. 39-year-old Manus Mothupi has been in custody since his arrest in July 2019, after his bail application was unsuccessful. Police are also investigating whether Mothupi could be linked to the stabbing and murders of five other homeless men at a park in Sunnyside. The trial has been postponed until the 7th of next month for further investigation. “We can confirm that the accused was charged with two counts of attempted murder. He was not linked to the murder cases of five people. Three of the deceased were identified and buried by their families while the two who were not identified were buried by the state. We are still investigating cases of murder. No arrest has been made. We are still appealing to anyone with information that can assist in this investigation to report to the nearest police station or call the crime stop number which is 08600 10111,” says police spokesperson Mavela Masondo.
