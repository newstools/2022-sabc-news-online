Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu has issued a statement on Thursday in which she disowns the statement from the Presidency saying that she had retracted her comments about the judiciary and had apologised for the hurt she had caused. Sisulu says in the statement that the Presidency statement is a misrepresentation of the meeting she had with President Cyril Ramaphosa on the matter. Sisulu says in the meeting, Ramaphosa shared his challenge with one aspect of the article on the judges. She explains that the President proposed an intermediary that would focus on the one line about the judges to resolve the matter. Sisulu further says in her statement that the content in the Presidency statement in its current form is unfortunate and she distances herself from it. The Minister says she will issue a full statement in the next 24 hours. Steve Motale confirms Minister Sisulu didn’t apologise for the judiciary comments:
