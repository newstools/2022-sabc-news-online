The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed optimism that there is now a demonstrable effort to make peace in Ethiopia. His office released a statement after he held a telephone conversation with African Union High Representative for the Horn of Africa, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo. Guterres indicated that he was briefed about efforts made by both the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front to move towards a resolution of the violent conflict. He expressed delight that after over a year of armed conflict affecting millions of people across Ethiopia and the rest of the region, there was increased optimism that there was now a real opportunity for a political and diplomatic resolution to the conflict. There have been protests regarding US interference on Ethiopian matters: He added that ongoing military operations in some parts of Ethiopia continued to pose a challenge to the peace process while souring the confidence-building measures he hoped were being taken by all parties to the conflict. The UN Chief called on the international community to continue emphasising the need for all parties to demonstrate sincerity and commitment to the peace process.
