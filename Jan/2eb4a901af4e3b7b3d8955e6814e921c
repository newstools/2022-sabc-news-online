Suspended African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule has lambasted the endorsement of some party members ahead of the party’s 55th elective conference in December. This, after party president, Cyril Ramaphosa was endorsed for a second term during the ANC’s 110th-anniversary celebrations in Polokwane last weekend. Magashule was speaking at the funeral of the late ANC member, Pule Mlambo in Randburg earlier on Saturday. VIDEO: ANC member Pule Mlambo laid to rest  ‘Dedicated soldier’ Mlambo died on Monday after a short illness. He was 59 years old. The late ANC member has been described as a dedicated person who understood what the liberation movement stood for. He served amongst others as the PR councilor in the Johannesburg metro and regional secretary in the Greater Johannesburg region. Bidding farewell to him, the suspended ANC Secretary General described Mlambo as a rare breed. He says Mlambo was a dedicated soldier of the struggle. “Comrade Pile was a very disciplined comrade. He’s a real mass mobiliser.” Magashule says things in the party have changed and people are no longer following the principles of the party, arguing that the ANC should honour the likes of Mlambo by implementing what they fought for. He also referred to the ANC’s performance during last year’s local government elections. “Stop lying to people saying the ANC did not lose during the election…” Magashule says the ANC has moved from the parties it was. -Additional reporting by Ntlantla Kgathlane
