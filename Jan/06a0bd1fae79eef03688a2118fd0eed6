The 11-year-old grade five learner who was abducted from the EP Baumann Primary School in Mayfair, Johannesburg, in November last year, has been reunited with her family. The Gauteng Department of Education (GDE) has confirmed that the child’s parents picked her up from a police station on Wednesday morning. The exact details surrounding her finding are still unknown at this stage. The learner was abducted by a group of armed men, whilst waiting in line to be sanitised outside the school. Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson, Steve Mabona says, “The Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is delighted that the Grade 5 girl learner from EP Baumann Primary School in Mayfair who was kidnapped last year returned safely today on Wednesday, 5 January 2022.” “According to information at our disposal, the learner’s mother received a call from the police this morning informing her to come to fetch her child at the police station. The parents then went to the police station to collect the child,” adds Mabona.
