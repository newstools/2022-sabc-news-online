On Tuesday morning parents stormed the Tjhebelopele Primary school in Bloemfontein and closed the gates preventing learners and teachers from entering the school’s premises. Parents are not happy with the appointment of the new school principal. They demand answers over the appointment of the new school principal. The acting principal who has been in the position for more than five years was reportedly told on Monday morning to make way for the new principal. Parents say they are in the dark. “We came here because we needed to understand why the principal was removed and we were not informed as the parents,” a parent elaborates. “We are not happy with what has happened to the principal. We should have been informed as parents,” another parent adds. “We are not happy with teachers at this school they send childrens to shops during school hours,” another parent explains. Meanwhile, a School Governing Body (SGB) member, Kabelo Hugo, says there has been a communication break-down on this matter. “The principal is being there acting for over five years. We are having questions as parents and the SGB, the problem is that the head did not talk to us or inform,” says Kabelo Hugo. Nonetheless Free State department of Education spokesperson, Howard Ndaba is adamant that all the processes to appoint the new principal were followed. “He applied and was shortlisted and unfortunately the position was awarded to someone else. We even appointed an independent panel to conduct the interviews,” says Howard Ndaba. The department is confident that teaching and learning will resume in earnest.
