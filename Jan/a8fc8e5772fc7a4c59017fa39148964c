The Financial and Fiscal Commission says its working on a new model to advise government on how to better spend public funds and improve service delivery, especially to the poor. The Commission is a statutory body that was established in 1994 to give independent advice to National Treasury on how to enhance the developmental impact of public resources through its budget allocations to National, Provincial and Local spheres of government. The Commission says it is concerned about the high levels of corruption across the three spheres of government in the country. The Commission says, the July unrest last year is a good example of how the waste of public funds is causing government to fail to take care of the basic needs of the poorest of the poor, which is its Constitutional duty. Budget cuts on social spending are also a big worry for the Fiscal Commission. Government says the budget cuts are necessary in order to reduce public debt. Ironically, the Commission is itself mired in controversy. It is said to have high levels of irregular, fruitless and wasteful expenditure. Last month, its CEO was suspended by the Board of Directors over allegations of misconduct.
