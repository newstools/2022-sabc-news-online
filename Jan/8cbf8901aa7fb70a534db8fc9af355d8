Workers who are members of the National Education, Health, and Allied Workers Union (Nehawu) in the Eastern Cape have downed tools at a number of schools that cater for learners with special needs. The strike is linked to the non-payment of overtime totalling R9 million, dating back to 2015. Nehawu says the provincial Education Department is dragging its feet regarding this matter. A School Governing Body (SGB) member at the school, Amanda Somekhetha says there have been no teaching and learning this year. “When we were about to open this year, Nehawu said that the learners and teachers shouldn’t set their foot at the school until they are paid. The problem is that the learners will not be educated,’ says Somekhetha.

We are managing it because we have sat with the social partners on a series of meetings wherein we have agreed in principle. For now, we are just waiting for the confirmation or authorisation from Treasury. We urge others to go back to work upon no time these monies will be paid into their accounts,” says Mtima.
