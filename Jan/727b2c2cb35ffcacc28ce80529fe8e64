African National Congress (ANC) Member of Parliament Mervyn Dirks has filed an urgent application in the Cape Town High Court to halt his suspension as the party’s Whip in Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa). This after he was suspended from party duties in Parliament last week. In papers before the court through his lawyer, former EFF Secretary General Godrich Gardee, Dirks challenges ANC Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina’s powers to suspend him. Dirks wrote a letter to Scopa at the end of last year asking it to investigate an audio clip in which President Cyril Ramaphosa allegedly admits to knowing that some ANC members had used state funds to run their ANC campaigns. Last week, Dirks was placed on precautionary suspension from his parliamentary duties after he allegedly failed to withdraw the letter to Scopa. He has likened his suspension to a “political lynching” and this would deter parliamentary oversight. His High Court urgent application is expected to be heard on Tuesday morning. Included in his urgent interdict are Majodina, the ANC, the President, and the Speaker of the National Assembly as well as the chairperson of Scopa. He says Majodina’s attitude towards him is based on the ANC’s factional politics which he says should not be allowed to overshadow the duties of parliament. He argues that the decision to suspend him has no merit and is unsustainable. He says it is an attempt by the dominant members of the ANC to prevent parliament from performing its oversight role and holding the executive to account. He adds that Majodina has failed to give him reasons why he should withdraw the letter to Scopa. VIDEO: ANC in Parliament to meet with MP Mervyn Dirks over letter to SCOPA
