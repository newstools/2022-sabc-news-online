Motorists in the Pretoria CBD are advised to avoid Sophie de Bruyn, Bosman and Paul Kruger streets ahead of an Economic Freedom Fighter (EFF) march on Thursday. The party will be marching to the Department Sports, Arts and Culture, calling for the reopening of stadiums to spectators. Stadiums have been closed after COVID-19 hit the country’s shores in March 2020. Plans were afoot to allow spectators to return through a phased-in approach, starting at a maximum 2 000 spectators per game. This was shelved after the emergence of the Omicron variant late last year. Red berets have started to gather at Princes Park ahead of their one and a half kilometres march to the department offices. Police are on high alert. Motorists are advised to use Thabo Sehume, Struben, Francis Baard and Nana Sita streets for the most part of today.

The association’s acting CEO, Siyabulela Loyilane, says: “It’s easy to say stadiums are open for 2 000 people however other events are open to 50% capacity. We want the same for the stadiums. They have been saying vaccinate, supporters have been vaccinating but stadiums cannot open solely because you have vaccinated. Supporters are not properly recognised in the country when they are stakeholders and need to be around the table when sports decisions are being taken. They need to be part and parcel of the decision-making process or at least to be consulted.” The artists say festivals at stadiums will assist with stimulating the economy.
