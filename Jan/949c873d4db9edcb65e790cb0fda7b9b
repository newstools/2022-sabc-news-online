The high court in Johannesburg has struck off the roll an application brought by lobby group Democracy In Action seeking to stop President Cyril Ramaphosa from receiving the first instalment of the State Capture report on Tuesday afternoon. The group argued during a virtual sitting of the court that the president was conflicted owing to the allegations made against him during testimonies at the State Capture commission – because of this, Ramaphosa was not best suited to receive this report.

NPA In December, National Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Shamila Batohi said that they are investigating many cases emanating from the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture hearings. Addressing the media in Pretoria, she said the institution is resourced enough to prosecute high-profile people in complex cases. Batohi says, “In the past two years, the unit has been able to enroll about 18 cases, 70% being criminal cases that are still being ventilated in court. While the balance relates to forfeiture civil recovery matters. The ID has also been dealing with Eskom matters but focusing on the Kusile Power Station.” “It has been able to obtain and confirm a R1 billion restrain in that respect and obtained unlimited restrain orders against the assets of the Gupta family through the company Island as well as the cases of Lulana Investment,” she said.
