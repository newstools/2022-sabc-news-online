The African National Congress (ANC)’s Lejweleputswa Interim Regional Committee (IRC) in Welkom in the Free State has denounced the attacks against the newly-elected executive mayor of Matjhabeng Local Municipality – Thanduxolo Khalipha. According to the IRC, the attack undermines the organisation’s efforts to implement the party’s commitment that comes with their election manifesto. Coordinator of the IRC Irvin Riet has called for calm and says they strongly condemn simmering tensions between members of the organisation and employees of the municipality. “We as the ANC in the region, [we] won’t allow anybody to attack the mayor of Matjhabeng whether in the media or in the public space. Because Khalipha is the deployee of the African National Congress. Therefore he has been given the authority by the council of Matjhabeng and also by the ANC, to see to it that the manifesto of the party is actually implemented and people get what is due to them in terms of service delivery,” explains Riet.
