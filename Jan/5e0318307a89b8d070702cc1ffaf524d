Cape Town firefighters are battling to extinguish a new blaze at Parliament after the fire that broke out in the National Assembly building on Sunday flared up again. Fire and Rescue Services have confirmed that the void beneath the roof sheeting of the National Assembly is on fire. Latest visuals from SABC News reporter Mercedes Besent:  At least 34 firefighters have been deployed to the scene as well as six firefighting appliances and a hydraulic platform from the Roeland Street fire station. Parliamentary spokesperson Moloto Mothapo says the resurgence of the fire follows earlier information regarding the risky high-temperature levels in the gutted buildings. Meanwhile, National Assembly speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula has lauded the overwhelming support they have received from both public and private entities. She says they have received offers from among others, the Cape Town International Convention Centre to use some of its facilities while repairs go on at Parliament. Mapisa-Nqakula also praised Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis who has offered the City Hall and the Council chambers for use by Parliament.
