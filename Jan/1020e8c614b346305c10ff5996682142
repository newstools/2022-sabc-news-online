You can’t just shoot the wife and husband together and what about the kids? If this mother and father die together, in the hands of criminals, what do you think of their kids?” #PoliceMinistry Police Minister Gen Bheki Cele and Deputy Minister Cassel Mathale are together with the SAPS Top brass today paying their last respects at the #FinalSalute official funeral service of fallen SAPS member Col Beauty Marivate, who was killed in the line of duty.
