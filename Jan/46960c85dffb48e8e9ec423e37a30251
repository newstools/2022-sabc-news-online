The hopes of an 18-year-old learner from St James Senior Secondary School at Cofimvaba in the Eastern Cape to go to a tertiary institution this year looks bleak. He failed to write his Geography Paper One last year due to a medical condition. Even though Sibabalwe Dubela passed six other subjects with distinctions, his matric statement shows that Geography is still pending. His brother-in-law, Ncedolwethu Mjuluki, believes this has a negative impact on his application for admission at institutions of higher learning. “Our brother cannot be admitted at the two higher institutions of higher learning because of the pending Geography results. This is why as a family, we are requesting the Eastern Cape Department of Education to utilize the process of Confession of an Exam by making use of the 2nd Paper marks together with the CAS mark to get the final result of the subject. Our brother has emotional and psychological problems. We are afraid he might cause self-harm and we say the Department must take responsibility,” says Mjuluki. Meanwhile, the class of 2021 obtained the highest number of Bachelor passes in the history of the National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations. Education Minister Angie Motshekga revealed this when she announced the overall pass rate at 76.4% last Thursday. The class of 2021 was lauded for obtaining the highest number of Bachelor passes in history:
