The murder case against the alleged mastermind behind the killing of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule has once again been postponed in the High Court in Johannesburg, to January 24. Pule’s body was found in an open veld in Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg in June 2020. She was eight months pregnant at the time. The murder accused, 32-year-old Ntuthuko Shoba was arrested at his home in Florida last year, after the man convicted of Pule’s murder, entered into a plea agreement with the state to testify against Shoba. In the video below, Tshegfatso Pule’s murder accused pleads guilty:  The trial was expected to resume today but it was postponed so both the state and defence can go over cell phone evidence. Pule’s family expressed disappointment at yet another postponement.
