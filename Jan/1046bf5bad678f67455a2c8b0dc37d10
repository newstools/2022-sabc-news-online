A new blaze broke out on Monday at the complex housing the two chambers of South Africa’s national Parliament in Cape Town, one day after a devastating fire swept through the buildings. “The fire and rescue service confirms that the fire at Parliament has flared up. The void beneath the roof sheeting of the National Assembly is on fire,” a spokesperson for the city’s fire services said on Monday afternoon.  Police have charged a 49-year-old man with arson and other offences including theft, and he was expected to appear in court on Tuesday. National Assembly speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula said the arson, if confirmed, would represent an attack on the country’s democracy.

However, important sections including a museum with artworks and heritage objects were saved, as was an embroidered tapestry telling the story of the Eastern Cape on the ground floor of theOld Assembly Building, officials said. Earlier on Monday firefighters had managed to extinguish most of the initial blaze. As the new fire flared, Parliament said firefighters had been reinforced with additional equipment and personnel. A city update released around 10 pm local time (2000 GMT) said the fourth and fifth floors of the new wing, above the national assembly, were “completely gutted” as wind-fanned flames threatened historic Tuynhuys, the Cape Town office of President Cyril Ramaphosa. “Heavy duty, aerial firefighting (equipment) have just arrived, that can operate within the current strong winds,” city officials said. The Parliament has played a crucial role in South Africa’s transition from white minority rule as the place where transformative legislation has been passed, helping roll back repressive policies implemented under the apartheid era. In a separate statement, the elite Hawks police said the suspect was believed to have gained entry to the Parliament through a window in one of the offices. Speaker Mapisa-Nqakula said President Ramaphosa’s address to Parliament, set for February 10, would still go ahead.
