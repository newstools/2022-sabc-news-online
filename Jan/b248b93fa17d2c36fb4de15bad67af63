The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) has showcased two case studies of people they claim to have been adversely affected after taking a Johnson and Johnson vaccine. According to their testimonies, the two people were in good health before taking the vaccine. The party has long been advocating against COVID-19 vaccinations. WHO encourages South Africa to continue rollout of the J&J vaccine:  Party leader, Kenneth Meshoe has lambasted the National Health Department for not releasing a fund that the party says was promised by government for those who have been negatively affected by vaccines. He was addressing the media in Braamfontein, Johannesburg earlier today. “We are aware that many South Africans who had had concerns about safety of the vaccines went to receive their jabs on the understanding that should anything go wrong, the state would be there to support them but finding information about the fund is a challenge. We don’t know how to apply, how to contact the fund, where its offices are. It’s very difficult.”
