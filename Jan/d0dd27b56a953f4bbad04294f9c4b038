The Gauteng Health Department has condemned the robbery of the Tshwane Health District vaccination team in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria. The workers were held at gunpoint on Friday by five men who ran off with their cellphones and two tablets that were used in the administration of vaccines. This is the second incident of its kind in Soshanguve. In December, another team was also robbed at gunpoint. “The continued attacks on mobile vaccination teams, who are taking the vaccine programme to the community are not only putting the lives of healthcare workers in danger, but they have a negative impact on the vaccination programme. In yet another incident, our partner Pulse Health team which is supporting the Soshanguve Block JJ vaccination team was robbed at gunpoint on Friday. We call on all members of society to work with law enforcement agencies to ensure that these perpetrators are brought to book,” says Kwara Kekana, Gauteng Health Spokesperson.
