The City of Tshwane says water has been restored to some areas of Pretoria West following supply disruption of more than a week due to the Iscor reservoir running dry. The water cuts affected residents of Proclamation Hill, West Park, Pretoria West Industrial and Kwaggasrand while infrastructure maintenance was carried out at the reservoir. Investigations have revealed that an obstruction blocked water from flowing into the reservoir. The City’s spokesperson Sipho Stuurman says while the water network has stabilised, it might take some time before supply is fully restored. “It takes some time before the supply is restored to residents, as the reservoir must first build-up while the water network must also build up and stabilise. Starting from Friday night, residents should have started to receive water and we believe that many residents have started receiving water but perhaps those that are in high inland areas might have struggled a bit but by today they should have all received water. In the case that we may still have outstanding cases of some areas that may not have water, we do have water tankers roaming around assisting those residents .”
