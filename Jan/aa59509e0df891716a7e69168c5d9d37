South Africa’s space programme has made history by launching three locally produced nano-satellites into space today. The trio of lightweight satellites called MDASat-1 was launched by South Africa-born billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX in Florida in the United States. The launch comes three years since the launch of ZACube 2, which is the technology demonstrator for the MDASat-1.
