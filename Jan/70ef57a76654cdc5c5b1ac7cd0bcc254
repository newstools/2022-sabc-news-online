Alleged Parliament arsonist, Zandile Mafe, intends to plead not guilty to the charges against him relating to the fire that gutted the old and new National Assembly buildings earlier this month. He is also planning to challenge the authenticity of reported video footage which allegedly shows him committing the crimes that he is charged with. The charges include terrorism, arson and housebreaking. In an unsigned affidavit handed to the Western Cape High Court by his defence team, Mafe claims that the terrorism charge is a ploy to make his bail application more onerous.
