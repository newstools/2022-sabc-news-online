Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has warned communities that when they disrupt schooling, their children will suffer the consequences. According to Lesufi, the worst performing district – Gauteng East – was plagued by parents disrupting schooling as a form of protest. The MEC hosted a breakfast for the province’s top matric performers. Gauteng got an impressive pass of 82,8%. Over 175 000 candidates sat for last year’s matric exams. More than 43% achieved bachelor’s passes and just over 47 000 distinctions were recorded. More than half of the candidates came from Quantile four and five schools. 18 Quantile 5 schools achieved a 100% pass rate, five of which attained bachelor pass rates above 95%. Quantile five are fee-paying schools in suburbs. Only 5 schools falling under Quantile 1 to 4 achieved 100% passes. Despite the air of celebration, the provincial education head appealed to parents to find other ways to register their frustrations. Lesufi says the worst performing district was in an area where parents often disrupted schooling. Lesufi says, “The worst performing district is Gauteng East at the very bottom with 77%. These are communities of Tsakane, Brakpan, Etwatwa, Duduza. I want to caution you that when you disrupt schools this is what you get. This community was involved in the July unrest, it’s also an area whenever parents are unhappy they disrupt schools.” The province’s top learner is Kristen Erasmus. The pupil from Hoërskool Waterkloof in Tshwane wants to join the ranks of chartered accountants. While the overall pass rate was above 80%, Gauteng learners are still not showing an appetite for gateway subjects. Less than 2 000 achieved distinctions in mathematics, science and accounting.
