An inmate and a prison official are being treated in hospital after a fight that claimed the life of one inmate at the Mthatha Correctional Centre in the Eastern Cape. Correctional Services Spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo says five offenders attacked four inmates and officials during an exercise session. Nxumalo says one of the five attackers succumbed to his injuries. “One official and inmate remain in hospital due to the seriousness of injuries that they sustain. This is a disturbing incident as Correctional Services has maintained to keep correctional services calm during the festive season. An internal investigation has been launched and SAPS is attending to the case.” Nxumalo adds, “An internal investigation has been launched and the SAPS is also attending to the case. The Judicial Inspectorate for Correctional Services has also been informed and is expected to run its own independent investigation.”
