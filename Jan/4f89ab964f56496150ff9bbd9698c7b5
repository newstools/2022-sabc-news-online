The man convicted of the murder of Tshegofatso Pule, has told the Johannesburg High Court that he was offered R70 000 to kill her. Muzikayise Malephane has taken the stand to testify against Ntuthuko Shoba, the alleged mastermind behind the murder. Malephane who has turned state witness alleges that Shoba offered him money to kill Pule, who was eight months pregnant at the time. Shoba was allegedly in an on-and-off relationship with Pule. Malephane says he picked up Pule at Shoba’s house on June 4, 2020, the day of the murder. In the video below,  in 2021, Tshegofatso Pule’s murder accused pleads guilty: Acting judge Stuart Wilson has asked Malephane if he needed time to compose himself as he struggled to look at pictures of the crime scene. Looking down and constantly rubbing his eyes, Malephane testified that Shoba called to inform him to pick up Pule. Malephane says he ultimately picked her up outside Shoba’s house in a silver Jeep – which was meant to be an Uber. He testified that he shot and killed her at Noordgesig and then went to Durban Deep in Roodepoort to hang her body from a tree. Malephane says Shoba called him the next day to check if the job was done. The two men later met in Meadowlands – Soweto, where Shoba allegedly told him that he was still trying to raise the money he promised to pay him. The trial continues.
