African National Congress (ANC) President Cyril Ramaphosa has visited the BaPedi Kingdom, with his Deputy, David Mabuza, meeting with the traditional leaders in Polokwane. African National Congress top leaders are spending the week in Limpopo, building up to the party’s 110th birthday celebrations.
