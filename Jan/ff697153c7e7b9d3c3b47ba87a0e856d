The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) says it is disappointed over the Judicial Conduct Appeals Committee’s decision to uphold the findings of the Judicial Conduct Committee (JCC) against former Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng. The ACDP also forms part of the lobby group “Friends of Israel” which supported Mogoeng. The appeals committee confirms that Mogoeng breached the Judicial Code of Conduct by involving himself in political controversy. He was found guilty by the JCC following a complaint that was laid by the South African Boycott Divestment Sanctions Coalition, Africa4Palestine and Women’s Cultural Group. Chief Justice Mogoeng ordered to apologise for pro-Israel comments:  This after Mogoeng made pro-Israel comments at a webinar hosted by an Israeli newspaper, – the Jerusalem Post in June 2020. Mogoeng has ten days to apologise unconditionally for his comments. ACDP Deputy Leader Wayne Thring says, “The ACDP is disappointed because we believe that the statements and the utterances of the former Chief Justice were from a biblical view and he has a right to freedom of expression as well as religious belief.” “We believe that the utterances that were made by the former Chief Justice were in alignment with his religious beliefs. We also believe that as a result of this decision, the [former] chief justice will use his knowledge [and] his experience as a Chief Justice to make the right decision without compromising his religious beliefs and conscience,” adds Thring.
