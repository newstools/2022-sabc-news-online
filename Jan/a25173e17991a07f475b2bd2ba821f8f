Gauteng police say they have arrested more than 1 400 suspects during crime prevention operations this weekend. The suspects were found to have committed offenses that include car hijacking, murder, rape, dealing in drugs, driving while under the influence of alcohol, armed robbery, and possession of suspected stolen property. Police spokesperson Mavela Masondo says the suspects will be appearing at the Lenasia Magistrate’s Court on Monday. “Among those arrested were four suspects that allegedly belong to a gang responsible for car hijackings and armed robberies in the south of Johannesburg. Police have been searching for the gang after several cases of hijacking and robbery of bank cards were reported in Lenasia, Ennerdale, De Deur, and Orange Farm. They will be appearing at Lenasia Magistrate’s Court on Monday, 10 January 2022, facing charges of car hijacking and armed robbery.” #sapsGP A gang that is alleged to be responsible for car hijacking and robbing people of their bank cards is among 1460 people arrested by Gauteng police over the weekend. #PoliceVisibility #SaferCommunities MLhttps://t.co/2dNF2q4Tf0 pic.twitter.com/F6lxGAELYj — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) January 9, 2022  Cele’s appeal to communities Police Minister Bheki Cele says communities need to get involved in protecting themselves. “These criminals who are heartless must face the anger of everybody, they must face the anger of all agencies, also they must face the anger of all communities. You can’t just shoot the wife and husband together and what about the kids? If this mother and father die together, in the hands of criminals, what do you think of their kids?” Cele was speaking at the Elukwatini stadium in Mpumalanga, during the funeral service of local police station commander Beauty Marivate. She died in hospital after being shot when attending to a business robbery in the area last week. Eight suspects have been arrested in connection with her murder.
