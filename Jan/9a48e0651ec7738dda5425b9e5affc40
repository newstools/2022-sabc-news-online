The man accused of setting Parliament alight earlier this month, Zandile Mafe, now faces an additional charge of terrorism. The other charges include arson, housebreaking, theft and the possession of explosives. The bail hearing of the 49-year-old accused is underway in the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court. Dozens of firefighters battled to extinguish the fire which broke out in Parliament‘s oldest wing on January 2. The National Assembly building was totally destroyed in the blaze. The video below is the court proceedings of this morning:  Support for Mafe Meanwhile, a group of homeless people has gathered outside the Cape Town Magistrate’s Court in support of  Mafe. Mafe’s supporters say it is not possible for him to have committed the crime. They believe he is being made a scapegoat. Venetia Orgill says she knows Mafe as she feeds the homeless at the city centre. “We are here to stand in solidarity with Zandile Christmas Mafe because we believe he’s innocent. There is no way he could have done to Parliament what they blaming him for. It is not him. It is not him,” Orgill adds.
