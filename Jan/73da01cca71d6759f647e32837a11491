Basic Education (@DBE_SA) January 1, 2022  Spokesperson for the department, Elijah Mhlanga says the difference in dates is aimed at accommodating people who may have travelled during the holidays. “The school year 2022 we have a staggered calendar, not all provinces are going to open at the same time. We have inland provinces that are going to go first on the 12th of January to open schools. And the provinces along the coastline will open schools on the 19th of January and here we are talking about KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape, and Northern Cape. And those are going to be opening on the 19th. And the rest of the provinces will open on the 12th, that is Mpumalanga, Gauteng, North-West, Free State, and Limpopo.” [REMINDER]: Here is the staggered 2022 School Calendar for inland provinces in South Africa. @Lesufi @DBE_SA pic.twitter.com/7Y36R396qD — Gauteng Department of Education (@EducationGP1) January 3, 2022
