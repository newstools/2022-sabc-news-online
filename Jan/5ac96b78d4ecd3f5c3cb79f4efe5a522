President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa needs to protect the Constitution and the democratic state from anyone who wants to weaken it. “We need to protect our Constitution, our democratic state and the electoral process from anyone who wants to weaken our democracy and deny the South African people of their hard-won freedom,” he writes. In his weekly letter to the nation on Monday, the President says all efforts must be made to ensure that citizens are not denied their hard-won freedoms through corruption, sabotage of economic infrastructure and attacks on the integrity of the judiciary. Ramaphosa also touches on the Zondo Commission report that paints a “deeply disturbing picture of how key institutions of our democracy were compromised and undermined with criminal intent.” He says the findings and recommendations of the Zondo Commission would help rebuild the country’s institutions that were destroyed by state capture. “We must ensure that we use them to safeguard these institutions into the future so that they may never be captured again. “The things that we have read in the Zondo Commission report should strengthen our resolve to defend the institutions of our democracy, all the entities of our state and, indeed, our democratic constitutional order.” We need to protect our Constitution, our democratic state and the electoral process from anyone who wants to weaken our democracy and deny the South African people of their hard-won freedom. https://t.co/AtovORAd1B pic.twitter.com/gipyoKplGl — Cyril Ramaphosa  (@CyrilRamaphosa) January 17, 2022
