Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Saturday reassured Mexicans that he was in good health following an overnight hospital stay for a cardiac catheterization procedure as part of a regular check-up. In a video, Lopez Obrador sat behind a desk and in a measured tone said the doctors cleared him to continue his work. “They found that the arteries were fine, without obstruction,” the leftist leader said in the video posted on Twitter. “Now I am back here in the (National) Palace, very calm and very happy.” “Governance has to be guaranteed, so I have a will for that,” Lopez Obrador said. “Fortunately, I don’t think it will be necessary.” Lopez Obrador underwent the procedure as part of a check-up every six months that include lab tests, electrocardiograms, stress tests and CT scans, the government said on Friday. Cardiac catheterization inserts a thin tube into a large blood vessel leading to the heart and can detect how well the heart is working.
