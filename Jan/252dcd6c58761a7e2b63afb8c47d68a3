An independent criminologist Professor Kholofelo Mothibi says the actions and behaviour of the Moti family regarding the kidnapping of their four kids are suspicious. This was after a group of men with rifles and handguns cornered their vehicle and forcefully removed them. However, the Moti family has now relocated from Polokwane in Limpopo to Dubai, arguing that it wants to create a safe environment for the four boys. The video below is reporting on the safe return of the Moti brothers:  The family has also denied reports that they have applied for a court interdict against the police to prevent them from interviewing the boys. Alaan, Zayyad, Zia and Zidan were abducted in October last year on the R37 near the N1 bypass, on their way to school just outside Polokwane. Professor Mothibi says the alleged legal war between the police and the family is making it difficult for the authorities to do their job. “The behaviour surrounding this whole issue, as a Criminologist, I will say it’s suspicious because if there are victims perpetrators should be arrested, the law should take its course. But with the new developments, it seems as if information should not be out. We will never get to know the nature of this crime and again, when we had the court interdict, we questioned as to whether there was a kidnapping. There are so many conspiracy theories surrounding this case.”
