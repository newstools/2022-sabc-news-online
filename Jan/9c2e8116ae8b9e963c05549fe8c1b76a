Four officials from the Western Cape Ministry of Community Safety have been placed on precautionary suspension, pending the outcome of an investigation into various allegations of misconduct. The investigations are linked to allegations levelled against former Provincial Community Safety Minister, Albert Fritz, who was suspended at the weekend. Spokesperson for the Premier’s office, Odette Cason, says the investigations are being conducted in accordance with labour laws that apply to public servants. She says they hope the probe will be finalised soon. Fritz also stepped aside from his position as DA leader in the province after an investigation into his conduct was launched.  Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape has called on Premier Alan Winde to provide reasons for suspending Fritz. Leader of the opposition in the legislature, Cameron Dugmore says, “Were these reasons about personal conduct? Were they about issues connected to his role as the MEC? The public has the right to know and we as the ANC in the Western Cape Legislature are insisting that the Premier come clean with the legislature and the Western Cape community as a whole and give us the reasons for this sudden suspension. We want to know and the public deserves to know.” –Additional reporting Lynne Arendse Below is the ANC statement reacting to Fritz’s suspension:
