The Pretoria Magistrate’s Court has postponed the case involving five alleged human traffickers to January 25. The four men and one woman were arrested on New Year’s Eve after the Hawks rescued a 17-year-old minor who reportedly left home in March 2021 and a 25-year-old woman at the accused’s flat in Sunnyside. The suspects aged between 19 and 40 years old are facing a charge of contravening the Trafficking in Persons Act 7 of 2013 for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The accused made a brief appearance in court, during what was expected to be a formal bail application. This after the court granted a seven-day postponement during their first appearance last week for further investigation. The state obtained a statement from the Department of Home Affairs, confirming the status of the four men in the country as illegal. Two of the suspects are also fugitives who had been on the run since 2019. They are allegedly linked to another human trafficking case, also being heard in the Pretoria High Court. The state has indicated that it will oppose bail. The video below is reporting on the court appearance of the suspects:
