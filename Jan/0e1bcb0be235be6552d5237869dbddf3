Incidents of kidnapping are on the rise in Mpumalanga and police are working around the clock to deal with the problem. Last week, seven kidnapped foreign nationals were rescued in Mbombela and Delmas. Two Pakistan nationals were rescued in Mbombela and five Bangladesh nationals were found in Delmas. All the victims were allegedly smuggled into the country through Mozambique. Police Spokesperson, Robert Netshiunda says their preliminary investigation has revealed that the suspects demanded ransom from the victims’ families. “During the raid, police also recovered three homemade firearms. The suspects, aged between 36 and 59 years old will appear before the Delmas magistrate’s court soon on charges of kidnapping, human trafficking and unlawful possession of firearms. The National Commissioner has welcomed this achievement and praised the teams involved, highlighting that more interventions have been put in place to overcome this sudden scourge of kidnappings.” Discussing the issue of kidnapping in SA with Herman Bosman
