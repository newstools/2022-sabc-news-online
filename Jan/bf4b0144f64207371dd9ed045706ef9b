Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema has defended the party’s decision to disband the Limpopo provincial leadership over the weekend. He says they can’t tolerate leaders who are lazy and therefore action needed to be taken. The EFF held its Central Command Team meeting in Boksburg, Johannesburg, over the weekend. Reports suggest that it is where Malema and the rest of the leadership took a decision to let go of the Limpopo provincial leadership. Malema has told the media that an interim leadership will be deployed to Limpopo soon. “It’s a very strong leadership which is not lazy, which is not taking any nonsense from anyone, they will never be bullied or undermined by anyone, I mean in the bullies that exists among those who are disgruntled in Limpopo. So, they will never take chances with the leadership we are sending there. So, we are guaranteed in 2024, Limpopo will give us a good result. I mean Limpopo was one of our biggest leaders.” In the report below, Malema speaks on the disbandment of leadership in Limpopo, and other outcomes of their meeting held in Boksburg over the weekend:   Plans for learners who passed matric Meanwhile, the EFF says no student who passed their matric exam in 2021 will languish on the streets.
