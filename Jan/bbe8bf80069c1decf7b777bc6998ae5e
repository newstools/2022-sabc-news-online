Former Old Mutual Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Peter Moyo says there was no conflict of interest on his part with regards to the dividend payment matter which resulted in his axing as CEO.

This was despite a written agreement between the two parties stipulating payment due dates which NMT allegedly failed to honour. Responding to a question in a virtual hearing before the Gauteng High Court, Moyo says if Old Mutual wanted to be paid it should have said so. “NMT did not pay the capital amount on the 30th of June because they were in discussion with Old Mutual for a rollover which was part of the agreement.
