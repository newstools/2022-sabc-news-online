The parents of slain student Leigh Matthews say the man who killed their daughter, Donovan Moodley, has shown no remorse almost two decades after the murder. Rob and Sharon Matthews are at the Johannesburg Correctional Services for Moodley’s parole hearing. Moodley abducted Matthews at gunpoint, gagged her, put her in the boot of her car and days later shot her four times. He was convicted in 2005 and received a life sentence for murder, 15 years for kidnapping and ten years for extortion.

We need to tell the parole board about the lies that Moodley continues to tell for the last 16 to 17 years. The fact that there’s no tangle remorse and the fact that how dangerous he is. We hope the system and the parole board can see that. That is what we would like to highlight,” adds Leigh’s father. Murder accused Donovan Moodley to apply for parole:
