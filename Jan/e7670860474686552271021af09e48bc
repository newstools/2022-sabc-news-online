Recently, council meetings had to be adjourned due to parties including the African National Congress (ANC), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and Aljama-Ah staging a walkout, saying they wanted a secret ballot in voting for committee chairpersons in Johannesburg. Da Gama said the election of the chairpersons of the municipality’s committees would be done in the next sitting on January 27. Al Jama-ah Gauteng Chairperson Thapelo Amad says: “The City of Johannesburg, we are declaring it to be a free Apartheid zone following the sequence of events in the city of Johannesburg Council which collapsed not only once but several times to a degree that the Speaker of council has alleged that councillors had been disruptive. We are saying no we were not disruptive. He flouted the rules the rules because we were trying to apply the rules of council.” Chaos erupts in Joburg council meeting:
