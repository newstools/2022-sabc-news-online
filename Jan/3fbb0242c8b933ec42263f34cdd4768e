Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says the complainants who have come forward with allegations implicating the province’s suspended Community Safety Minister Albert Fritz of serious misconduct have been informed that they have the option to lay criminal charges. Winde says he has approached the State Attorney, instructing that independent legal counsel be appointed to conduct an external investigation into the veracity of the undisclosed allegations against Fritz. He says the details of the appointee will be made public once the instruction has been confirmed. “These complainants have brought these allegations to me under the strictest of confidence. To publish their names in the media, against their will, will only add to the very serious stress and anxiety that they are feeling now, and possibly deter others from coming forward in similar cases in future. I ask for editors and other interested parties to consider the best interests of these complainants and not to publish their names, unless they have provided explicit consent,” adds Winde. Fritz also stepped aside from his position as Interim Provincial Leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) following the allegations. The African National Congress (ANC) in the Western Cape says the manner in which Premier Winde is dealing with the allegations against Fritz, makes it seem as if he is trying to cover up the situation. Leader of the ANC in the Provincial Legislature, Cameron Dugmore, says Winde should provide more details regarding the investigation that is being conducted into Fritz’s alleged misconduct. Meanwhile, Deputy Leader of the Patriotic Alliance, Sammy Claasen, says they will protest on the steps of the Western Cape Provincial Parliament if Premier Winde does not reveal details regarding allegations of misconduct, which have been levelled against Fritz.
