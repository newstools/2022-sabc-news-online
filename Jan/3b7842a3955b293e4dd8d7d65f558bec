The ashes of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu have been interred at St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town in a private family service earlier on Sunday. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba of Cape Town laid the ashes to rest in front of the high altar of the Cathedral in a 30-minute service beginning at 6am. He called on South Africans to use the time of Tutu’s passing to “turn a new page”. Makgoba has also suggested that Cape Town’s airport be renamed the Archbishop Desmond Mpilo International Airport. The service was also attended by several clergy and twenty members of the Tutu family, led by his wife Nomalizo Leah Tutu. Another memorial service is being planned by the Anglican Church in the UK at a date still to be announced. The video below is Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu’s funeral service:
