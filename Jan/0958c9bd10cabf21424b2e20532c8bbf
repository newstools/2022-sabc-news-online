ActionSA has announced that former Midvaal Municipality Mayor, Bongani Baloyi, is officially a part of ActionSA. The party made this announcement during a media briefing in Sandton, Johannesburg. Baloyi surprised many in the country after he announced his resignation from the Democratic Alliance a few months ago. He says he finds himself at home within ActionSA and is looking forward to imparting his skills as a public servant in his new home. Baloyi says the 2024 national and provincial elections will be his main focus. Both @HermanMashaba and @BonganiBaloyiEM are committing to making sure the ANC is "taken out of power" in 2024 during the general elections. #SABCNews pic.twitter.com/zM70HcX3G5 — Abongile Dumako (@AbongileDumako) January 24, 2022  Baloyi says, “If someone who can take a decision to start a journey and build a party for all South Africans, look at the outcome of it. So I’m excited to add my little contribution to this team. Enthused to work towards the 2024 goal to dislodge the ANC. And it’s something I’m pledging to commit to doing as seen fit by ActionSA confidence. So I’m really excited and as they say azikhale.”
