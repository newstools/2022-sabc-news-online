The African National Congress (ANC) caucus in the Mangaung Metro says it stands by its decision to appoint Acting City Manager, Sello More. This, despite a damning court order that ruled that More’s appointment by Cooperative Governance of Traditional Affairs MEC Mxolisi Dukwana was unlawful as powers to appoint a City Manager rest upon the metro council and not the MEC. The Free State High Court found that the COGTA MEC acted beyond his scope of duties. Mangaung Metro Executive Mayor Mxolisi Siyonza says they will appeal the high court judgment. “Remember Mangaung took some of the employees to court.  I’m talking about those who are serving in the Metro Police. The merit of the case the court did not deal with it. They only dealt with technicalities, among others is the issue of the appointment of the City Manager of which we looked at it. Remember council has appointed the City Manager and my role is to defend the council resolution. That’s why we are appealing.” ANC caucus in the Mangaung Metro stands by its decision to appoint Sello More as Acting City Manager:
