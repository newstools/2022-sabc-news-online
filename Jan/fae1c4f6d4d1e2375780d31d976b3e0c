There are growing calls for the government of Botswana to withdraw a controversial bill from parliament. The African Editors’ Forum and other media lobby groups say the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Bill will empower the Botswana government to intercept communication and impede media freedom. They have labelled the legislation as draconian and say it’s been rushed to parliament without public scrutiny. The introduction of the Criminal Procedure and Evidence Bill has sparked intense debate in Botswana. The bill will empower law enforcement agencies to intercept the communication of journalists and other citizens, and force them to disclose information. It will also allow intelligence agents to use fake identities and be immune from prosecution. Media groupings in Botswana such as MISA Botswana, the Press Council and Botswana Editors’ Forum are concerned. “It’s going to affect media freedom negatively no number. As you know investigative journalists rely on anonymous sources and in this instance the investigating agencies will have the legal power to intercept and listen to information and people will be afraid to give journalists information,” says Tefo Phatshwane from Media Institute of Southern Africa. The African Editors’ Forum says it stands in solidarity with the media lobby groups in Botswana. It says the bill will jeopardize freedom of expression and is a direct threat to the work of journalists. “The African Editors’ Forum is horrified at the draconian piece of legislation, it will have a chilling impact on the media and other liberties we call on the government of Botswana to withdraw the criminal procedure and build the country’s democracy by introducing media-friendly bills,” says Jovial Rantao, African Editors’ Forum Chair. Meanwhile, the government of Botswana has yet to respond and thoroughly explain the rationale behind the legislation.
