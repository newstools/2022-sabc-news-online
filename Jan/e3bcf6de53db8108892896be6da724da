Columnist and Independent Political Analyst Melanie Verwoerd says there’s much to be learned and remembered from the late Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. Verwoerd says Tutu’s legacy should motivate people to act in ways that he did. “He played a very big role in my life in terms of why I joined politics, how I ended up in Parliament. His deep humanity, spirituality and incredible sense for forgiveness is the fact that he reached out to somebody like me who carried this very heavy surname. A surname that was not only hurtful to millions of South Africans but hurtful to him too,” says Verwoerd. The funeral service of the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu is officially under way inside the St George’s Cathedral in Cape Town. Tutu passed away last Sunday at the age of 90 and will be cremated following his funeral and as per his wishes, have his ashes interred in the Cathedral. Verwoerd says Tutu challenged conventional wisdom and was a multi-faceted man. She says Tutu showed what true forgiveness means.
