Parliament says it welcomes the decision of the High Court in Cape Town to strike the Economic Freedom Fighters’ (EFF) urgent court application for an interim interdict off the roll. The EFF wanted the court to suspend the implementation of sanctions against its Members of Parliament who were found guilty of disrupting Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordan’s budget vote speech more than two years ago, pending the review court application. EFF MPs disrupt Pravin Gordhan during budget vote: This came after the Powers and Privileges Committee found various EFF MPs guilty and recommended sanctions against them. The recommended sanctions in the committee’s report included fines and the docking of one month’s salary. Parliament’s spokesperson Moloto Mothapo, “The report which was adopted by the National Assembly on the 7th of December last year recommended various sanctions against 16 MPs of the EFF for the disruption caused during the Minister of Public Enterprise Pravin Gordhan’s budget vote speech on 11 July 2019. The application for the interim interdict before the court pending the finalisation of the EFF’s review application which was launched in December 2020. The EFF sought to have the committee report and the process leading up to its adoption declared unlawful, reviewed and set aside. The review is yet to be enrolled for a hearing.”
