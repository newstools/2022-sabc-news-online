The defence team of alleged arsonist Zandile Mafe is on Tuesday expected to challenge a Cape Town Magistrate’s Court order for his admission to Valkenberg hospital for mental observation. This is after the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) informed the court that a district surgeon had diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Mafe faces several charges including terrorism, relating to the fire which destroyed parts of Parliament earlier this month. He is expected to plead not guilty to the charges. The hearing will take place in the High Court in Cape Town. Cape Judge President John Hlophe and a second judge are expected to preside over the hybrid proceedings. Mafe’s defence attorney, Luvuyo Godla says the referral for mental observation without his client being given an opportunity to consult a private psychiatrist is draconian and questionable. “If we were advised before the 11th, we could have made our own referral as well but now it’s water under the bridge. This court must determine on Tuesday whether or not that was lawfully done and procedurally correct,” says Godla. Zandile Mafe | Update on bail hearing
