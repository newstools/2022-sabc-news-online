As schools in inland provinces Gauteng, Free State, Mpumalanga, North West and Limpopo get ready for the return of learners this Wednesday, Non-Governmental Organisation Thusangwanageno is hard at work making sure that school facilities are ready for occupation. The organisation has been painting schools in different areas and covering learners’ books. The founder of the organisation, Dr. John Molepo, says this is to ensure that schools are conducive to learning. “We decided to make schools look better so that learners can feel great in their classes. We also covered books because we want uniformity at schools and also wanted to assist parents who cannot afford covers. So, the initiative is about making a change in our communities.” Thusangwanageno was founded in 2015 with the aim to assist learners and students who are struggling financially.  So far this year, the organisation has managed to paint and cover books at seven schools including, among others, Mmabana Primary School, DC Marivate Junior Secondary School, and Diopong Primary School.  Molepo says more schools have been in contact with the organisation, seeking help on different challenges. He has called on people to assist the organisation with donations and offer hands for covering books. “Those that want to be involved can contact us. We are indeed looking for assistance. We depend on donations and also on our salaries. We appeal to society to donate to us. We really need funds to run this.”  The organisation also plans to donate mini-libraries, pay registration and tuition fees and continue to assist with learners and driver’s licenses. “We are always looking to partner with government and any organisation. We will continue to engage with the government were necessary.”
