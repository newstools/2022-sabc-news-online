Retired Anglican Bishop of Natal Michael Nuttal will be the preacher at the funeral of Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu. Archbishop Thabo Makgoba will preside over the service. The 90-year-old Tutu will be cremated after the church service. Tutu’s mortal remains will be interred inside the St George’s Cathedral. Makgoba explains how the Anglican process works to select a preacher during the burial of an Anglican Archbishop: “Bishop Michael Nuttal the retired Bishop of Natal who was the Dean of the Province that is the second to Archbishop Desmond Tutu by the time he was Archbishop and appointed by the Archbishop while he was still alive will be the preacher, that is how the Anglican Church works. Every Archbishop has got his own Dean of the Province.” “And the current Dean of the Province who assists me is Bishop Matlosana Molopi Diseko and so number two to Tutu will be our preacher to delivering the homily. As the Archbishop, I will do the service and the internment of the ashes,” adds Makgoba. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on the public to remember those who lost their lives in 2021, including leaders and activists such as Tutu. Ramaphosa was delivering his New Year’s message to the nation. “In the course of the year, we have lost men and women who were pillars of strength in our communities – leaders, activists and veterans of our struggle for liberation. On Saturday, the nation will gather in spirit to lay to rest our beloved Archbishop Tutu. We have had to weather many storms in this past year,” say President Ramaphosa.- Livestream: Funeral service of the late Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu:  Additional reporting by Risha-Maduray
