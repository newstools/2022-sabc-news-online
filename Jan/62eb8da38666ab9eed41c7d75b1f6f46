Botswana President, Mokgweetsi Masisi, is in mandatory self-isolation after testing positive for COVID-19 in routine testing. A government spokesperson says the President does not have any symptoms and doctors will continue to monitor his health. Vice President Slumber Tsogwane will assume the President’s responsibilities while Masisi is in isolation. New coronavirus infections have risen sharply in the diamond-rich southern African country to an average of 2500 every three days from under 300 over the same period before the detection of the Omicron variant late last year. But health officials say hospitalizations have not spiked.
