Emotions are still running high in the High Court in Johannesburg as convicted murderer Muzi Malepane continues to testify on how he shot and killed Tshegofatso Pule. Malepane is currently serving a 20-year sentence for the murder of Pule who was eight months pregnant when she was killed in June 2020. Her family members, sitting in the public gallery, could not hold back their tears as they listened to his testimony. Malepane turned state witness in the trial of the alleged mastermind behind Pule’s murder, Ntutuko Shoba. Malepane testified that he picked Pule up at Shoba’s home and drove her to a veld in Noordgesig where he shot and killed her. He told the court that he then drove her body to Durban Deep. The trial continues on Thursday. Ntuthuko Shoba | Alleged mastermind of Tshegofatso Pule’s murder denied bail yet again in 2021: On Wednesday, Malepane said he was angry that it was Ntutuko Shoba that told police about CCTV footage after he was arrested. State witness Malepane has told the court that he did not tell the police the entire truth around Pule’s murder when he made a statement after his arrest. He said he confessed to the murder, pointed out the crime scene, and concealed Shoba’s involvement. This was up until he heard from the police that the evidence retrieved from CCTV footage, when he picked up Pule, was information provided by Shoba. He says he was angered by the betrayal hence decided to tell the whole truth claiming Shoba was the mastermind behind the murder. Malepane has also been questioned about threats he made to Shoba while in prison – saying he will unleash the 26 and 28 gangs to sexually assault him. Malepane says it was just talking and nothing more.
