Former Free State MEC for Police, Roads and Transport Butana Komphela has been described as a versatile leader who showed a spark at a difficult time for the party at his funeral service in  Kroonstad. Komphela died on Monday after being admitted to a hospital in Bloemfontein for over a month. He died after a long illness and a recent abrupt battle with COVID-19 which was complicated by his underlying lung conditions. Free State African National Congress (ANC) Interim Provincial Committee spokesperson Oupa Khoabane says he spent time in jail with Komphela during the height of apartheid. Komphela has been credited for the role he played for the ANC in Kroonstad after the unbanning of the political parties. This led to him being elected as a Mayor of Kroonstad as part of the Transitional Local Government. Khoabane has praised Komphela’s outstanding leadership. Mourners gather to pay last respects to the late Butana Komphela:  Khoabane says when Komphela was reshuffled, he showed humility and demonstrated the party’s principle of discipline. Meanwhile, a number of cabinet ministers are among the dignitaries attending the funeral service. Some of the ministers attending the funeral in Kroonstad include Lindiwe Sisulu, Fikile Mbalula, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi and Dr Joe Phaahla.
