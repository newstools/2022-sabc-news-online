The main suspect accused of the kidnapping of an 11-year-old girl outside her schoolyard in November last year has been arrested in Mozambique. The girl was rescued at a house in Devland, Soweto on Tuesday night during an Intelligence-led operation. Police spokesperson Robert Netshiunda says the girl was rescued unharmed and was taken to a medical facility for medical examination and has since been reunited with her family “The suspects who were at the house evaded arrest. A 40-year-old man was arrested in Mozambique on Friday [31 December 2021] and Interpol is busy with the extradition process. Two other suspects, Ayanda Kekana (50) and Fortune Kambule Ndlovu (36) were arrested in December 2021 in connection with the same kidnapping and their bail application was denied when they appeared at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on 7 December 2021. They will be back in court on Friday, 7 January 2022. Police investigations continue,” says Netshiunda.  #sapsHQ An 11-year-old girl who was snatched outside her school yard in November 2021 was rescued in Devland, Soweto last night during an Intelligence led operation. 40-year-old suspect arrested in Mozambique on Friday, 31 December 2021.
