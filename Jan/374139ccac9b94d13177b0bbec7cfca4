The eThekwini municipality has closed a number of beaches due to abnormally murky water that is being discharged from the Umgeni River and into the surf. The affected beaches are North Beach, Bay, Battery Country Club, eThekwini and Laguna beach. Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela says bathing and sporting activities like fishing are prohibited until tests can shed more light on the water quality. “We sincerely apologies for the inconvenience this is going to cause. And it should be noted that we were left with no choice but to take this decision to protect the welfare of our tourists, of our residents.” “We are currently conducting tests whose outcomes will determine our next course of action. The outcomes are also going to be communicated to the public,” says Mayisela.
