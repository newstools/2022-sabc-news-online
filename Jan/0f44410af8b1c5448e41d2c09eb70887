The Tshegofatso Pule murder trial is expected to continue on Tuesday at the Johannesburg High Court. Pule was murdered in June 2020 while she was eight months pregnant. The alleged mastermind behind the murder, Nthuthuko Shoba was arrested at his home in Florida on Gauteng’s West Rand earlier in 2021. His arrest came after the man convicted of Pule’s murder, Muzikayise Malephane, entered into a plea agreement with the State to testify against Shoba. The State has wrapped up the testimony from its first witness Tshepiso Tsita who was friends with Pule. Tsita told the court that Pule received threatening cellphone text messages prior to her murder. “A specific lady was sending threats that Tshegofatso must leave her man or she would come to her workplace, specifically and deal with her. And she said that she was HIV positive and Tshegofatso must go get tested,” added Tsita. In the video below, Tshegfatso Pule’s murder accused pleads guilty:
