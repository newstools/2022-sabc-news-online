Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) will inform Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane that it is dealing with certain aspects of a complaint that African National Congress (ANC) MP Mervyn Dirks has brought to her attention. Dirks has also lodged a complaint with Mkhwebane’s office. The complaint relates to President Cyril Ramaphosa’s knowledge of alleged misuse of state funds for political party activities. Dirks also wants the President to share information about his knowledge of the allegations with Scopa. This follows a leaked audio recording which is circulating on social media about Ramaphosa’s utterances during an ANC NEC meeting. It will give the President up to ten days to respond in writing. Scopa Chairperson Mkhuleko Hlengwa has noted that Dirks has instituted a parallel investigation into the matter. On Tuesday, Hlengwa explained the importance of informing the Public Protector. “That we are dealing with a particular aspect now of an issue which is being brought before her by Mr Dirks and to also maintain a healthy co-operation with all institution of the state.” Parliamentary legal advice indicated that the Public Protector is the one who investigates the conduct of the President in terms of the Executive Ethics Code. This means she will also come up with her own findings and recommendations after concluding the investigation. The outcome may include whether the President has breached the Executive Ethics Code or not – and if there are any sanctions that should be taken against him for breaching the Code. Meanwhile, political analyst Dr Ralph Mathekga has described as unprecedented  Dirks’ decision to write a letter to Scopa, about Ramaphosa. SCOPA meets over call for Ramaphosa to be held accountable:
