Winde has reiterated his call to end the National State of Disaster to help the economy recover. “The good news is that the Western Cape has now officially exited the fourth wave. It is also time that we end the national state of disaster too and we start to focus on this pandemic which is one of unemployment, one of poverty. It is critical that we move on to this focus,” says Winde.
