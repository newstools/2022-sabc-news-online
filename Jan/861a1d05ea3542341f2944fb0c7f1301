The South African National Blood Service (SANBS) is appealing for more support from its donors in KwaZulu-Natal. The blood service says they currently have just over three days of blood stocks in the province and are trying, by all means, to increase it to five days of blood stocks. SANBS communications officer Khensani Mahlangu says they continue to host multiple blood drives at various schools, communities and corporate institutions to increase their daily supply. SANBS encourages people to donate blood over the festive season:  “The SANBS has been experiencing chronic blood shortages since we have only been able to meet the demands of the hospitals with the assistance of our donors who continue to come in and support us. At this point, we continue to implore communities, schools and corporate institutions to host blood drives and to help us to save lives. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated people are welcome.” Last year October it was reported that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospitals has stretched blood supplies in the country. And the SANBS has experienced poor collection due to, among other challenges, low donor turnout to mobile blood drives and donor centres.
