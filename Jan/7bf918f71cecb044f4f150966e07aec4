Goldman Sachs Group Inc is encouraging its eligible US staff to work from home until January 18, a company spokesperson said, as it followed a number of its rivals in altering return-to-office plans as the Omicron variant spreads. Goldman’s offices will continue to remain open with previously announced COVID-19 safety protocols, the spokesperson added. Those measures are: a vaccine requirement, booster requirement for all eligible populations effective February 1, bi-weekly testing effective Jan. 10, and mandatory masks.
