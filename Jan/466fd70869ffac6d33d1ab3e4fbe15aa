Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says the department is working closely with parents and schools to intensify its efforts to vaccinate learners from the start of the 2022 academic year. This is in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19 as learners return to school. During a media briefing on the readiness of schools ahead of the start of this academic year, Motshekga says learners will not be forced to vaccinate if they don’t want to. “Now working with our SGB’s, parents and the Department of Health, we will intensify our programme to encourage young people to vaccinate and also encourage parents to get their children vaccinated. We also have reports from parents saying that they hear we are going to vaccinate their children without their permission which is a bit uncomfortable but we will work with them at all costs to work with them and get their permission. But vaccination programmes are run by the Department of Health and not us so if 12-year-olds go and present themselves at a vaccination site to get vaccinated it is completely out of our control.” Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga media briefing on the state of readiness for 2022:
