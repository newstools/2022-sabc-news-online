Suspended African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, has failed in his bid to overturn the High Court order which upheld his suspension from party activities. Magashule petitioned the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein after the High Court in Johannesburg refused him leave to appeal the judgment. He believed that there were inconsistencies in the High Court ruling:  The SCA has dismissed with costs Magashule’s application for leave to appeal the High Court judgment, saying there were no reasonable prospects of success. The SCA said there was no compelling reason as to why it should hear an appeal. Magashule was suspended by the ANC in May 2021 after he refused to voluntarily step aside following his criminal prosecution. Magashule, ten others, and five companies face more than 70 charges of fraud, corruption, and money laundering in the High Court in Bloemfontein. The charges stem from the alleged irregular awarding of the R255 million asbestos roof removal tender in the Free State. The alleged crimes were committed when Magashule was still the Free State premier.
