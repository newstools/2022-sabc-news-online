The City of Tshwane says technicians are working on restoring water in some areas of Pretoria West. Residents in Proclamation Hill, West Park, Pretoria West Industrial and Kwaggasrand have been without water for more than 10 days due to the Iscor reservoir running dry. This is due to infrastructure maintenance that was carried out at the Heights reservoir which feeds the Iscor reservoir. The city says investigations revealed that there was an obstruction which blocked water from flowing into the reservoir. The City of Tshwane Spokesperson, Sipho Stuurman says, “Following extensive investigations by the technical team, it was found that there is an obstruction between the reservoir and the downstream bulk water meter as the meter was not running.” “ The team has started with the maintenance work that includes scouring the system, stripping the meter to clear the blockage and cleaning the reservoir. The process will run today. During this period the city has arranged roaming water tankers to the affected areas.” #UPDATE Water interruptions affecting Pretoria west areas. pic.twitter.com/UogC9hfsnL — City of Tshwane (@CityTshwane) January 21, 2022
