A group of disgruntled parents has gathered outside the main entrance of Hoërskool Theresa Park in Pretoria North. They’re insisting that the school admit their children for the Grade 8 academic year.

Her peers are all going to private schools. Now, because I cannot afford a private school now I must suffer.” “My child must be placed 12 kilometers away from home and I must suffer with transport. I must also worry about my child’s safety while there’s a school next to my home.” “What’s the point of having to apply online if my child is still going to suffer in January? Let’s go back to queues which was the old system, so at least I know where my child is going come next year,” adds Radipape. Nick Mokone who has been to a number of schools in the area in an attempt to secure a place for his son, says even at the district offices parents have been left frustrated. “Very chaotic, we went there very early in the morning. The officials stood on the other side of the gate while we are on the other side of the crowds.
