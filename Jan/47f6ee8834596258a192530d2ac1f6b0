The family of a 20-year old woman, who confessed to having hired hitmen to kill her parents and two siblings at Mmakau near Brits in December 2016, says it’s difficult to accommodate her. Onthatile Sebati has been granted bail of R10 000. Her co-accused Tumelo and Kagiso Mokone who are cousins, were also granted bail of R10 000 each by the Brits Magistrate’s Court. They’re facing five counts of murder, theft and armed robbery. Accused granted bail:  Sebati’s uncle Kabelo Brown was at the court to observe the proceedings. “That is going be very difficult for me because everyone in the family will be looking at me. It will be tough for me. On the paternal and on my side. Even my wife I don’t think she’s going to accept her. I really don’t. Maybe after we are healed when time goes on,”  Brown explains.
