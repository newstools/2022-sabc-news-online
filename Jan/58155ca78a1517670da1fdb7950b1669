The murder case of the alleged mastermind behind the killing of 28-year-old Tshegofatso Pule will be back in the High Court in Johannesburg on Monday morning. In June 2020, Pule’s body was found in an open veld at Roodepoort, west of Johannesburg. She was eight months pregnant at the time. The alleged mastermind behind the murder, Nthuthuko Shoba was arrested at his home in Florida on Gauteng’s West Rand earlier this year. His arrest came after the man convicted of Pule’s murder, Muzikayise Malephane, entered into a plea agreement with the state to testify against Shoba. Shoba’s lawyer Norman Makhubela told the court that due to COVID-19 restrictions at the prison, they have not had fruitful consultations with the accused. The State was not opposed to the application. Pule’s family has expressed disappointment saying there was plenty of time to consult the murder accused. They say the defence is using delaying tactics.
