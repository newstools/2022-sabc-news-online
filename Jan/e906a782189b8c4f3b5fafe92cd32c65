The eThekwini Municipality Speaker Thabani Nyawose says councillors are under siege as they are exposed to death threats. He was speaking at the home of slain councillor Minenhle Mkhize who was gunned down at his residence on Saturday night. Municipal Speaker Thabani Nyawose speaks to SABC reporter Bongani Gema:  He described the death of Mkhize as a great loss to the municipality and the community of Cliffdale. “We feel that being a public servant, in particular, being a councillor is now becoming a difficult job because we now live in fear, we are being attacked. We are receiving death threats again and again but what happened in this family by the assassination of councillor Minenhle Mkhize, we want to send our deepest condolences to the family and the community of Ward 103,” says Nyawose. Councillors want security Nyawose says there are eight councillors in the eThekwini Municipality who have approached his office to request security protection services. He says Mkhize has never reported any death threats. “As we have said in our address to the community, we have never received any request from him for protection because there was no threat directed to him in what so ever anyway, he was never threatened. I have only eight requests in my office from different councillors, from different political parties but from Minenhle Mkhize, we have never received any request for protection,” says Nyawose.
