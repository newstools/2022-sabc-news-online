A person has been shot and wounded and property damaged over a disputed piece of land between the Nkuna and Mokgolobotho traditional authorities outside Tzaneen in Limpopo. The wounded person has been hospitalised. The Nkuna traditional authority allegedly allocated residential sites on a disputed piece of land between Dan and Mokgolobotho villages. The Mokgolobotho traditional authority then sought an interdict and an eviction order from the High Court in Polokwane. The Mokgolobothos later appointed a private security company to enforce the eviction order. Nkuna traditional authority spokesperson Nkakasana Muhlava says people’s property has been damaged. “Of course, we are angry and feel bad about what happened because our people’s property has been destroyed and some of their valuable items burned. The security company damaged their property went to an extent of shooting members of a family near Letaba Cross,” says Muhlava. The Mokgolobotho traditional authority says development on the piece of land was illegal. Chief Joseph Mokgolobotho says legal processes were followed after the alleged illegal occupation of the land. “We were following the judgment from the High Court which the judge had taken. That judgment has three court orders which one is a court order the second one is a court interdict and the third one is the eviction order,” says Chief Mokgolobotho.
