There is high visibility of law enforcement authorities in and around the city of Durban ensuring overall safety and stability as hundreds flock into the city’s beaches to celebrate the New Year. On Friday, a number of revellers opted to spend their New Year’s Eve at various entertainment spots around the City. Nelisiwe Ndlovu and Nathi Ntimba from Nelspruit say they are really enjoying being outdoors without looking at their watch. “It’s amazing there’s a lot of things to do. Just go out have fun, eat and our new year’s resolutions are to work hard, go back to school make money!!” says Ndlovu. “I’m hoping that no more COVID-19, no more lockdown. For me, on my side, I’m tired of this lockdown thing,” says Ntimba. Drunk driving is a major festive season concern for traffic authorities:  Meanwhile, some businesses have welcomed the lifting of the curfew saying it will improve their business. Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Maqaqa Exclusive Lifestyle, Hlengiwe Ngwabe, says it has been difficult to keep their doors open due to COVID-19 regulations. “For the curfew to be lifted, it means that we will be working a lot more. We will be making more money, we will be having more people at our place to come and have fun with us. For the curfew to be lifted, it will give us an opportunity as well to attract more people from different places because people find it difficult to actually come from Port Shepstone to come from PMB to come to Maqaqa only to find that by 10 or by 11 o clock they have to go,” says  Ngwabe.
