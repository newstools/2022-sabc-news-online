The deputy head of Sudan’s military-led Sovereign Council said on Saturday a UN envoy should be working as a “facilitator and not a mediator”, signalling an apparent tougher line towards international efforts to resolve a political crisis. A United Nations mission led by special envoy Volker Perthes began talks this month to help resolve the standoff which followed a coup last year. Previously, the Sovereign Council has welcomed the UN initiative, and Perthes has said the army had no objections to his presence. The Council was not shunning the international community but “rejects interference in domestic affairs,” he said. Dagalo’s statement did not explain what had prompted his comment. Perthes and the Council could not immediately be reached for comment.
