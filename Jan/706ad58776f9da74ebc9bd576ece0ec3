Water supply will be disrupted to at least 10 areas in the northern suburbs of Cape Town on Monday, for repairs on a leaking 650mm pipeline. The City of Cape Town says the water supply will be cut off in Blue Downs, Brentwood Park, Camelot, Hagley, Highgate, Malibu Village, Nuwe Begin, Silversands, Summerville, Sunbird Park, Wembley and Wesbank from 9am. The city says the water supply to these areas was highly constrained this weekend and any more pressure could lead to pipe bursts. The city has advised residents to store clean water ahead of time. It says water tankers will be provided through the areas for domestic use. The City’s Water and Sanitation Department will be doing the permanent repairs to the leaking 650mm diameter pipeline on Monday 24 January 2022.

The shortage is not only in Cape Town but has affected many other municipalities throughout the country as the supplier and manufacturer are apparently operating at 50% of its capacity. Mayoral Committee Member for Water and Sanitation in the City of Cape Town Zahid Badroodien says the City has however just received a new supply that will last for about a week. The shortage could affect the treatment of drinking water. Badroodien says they are reducing chlorine quantities where it is safe to do so in order to stretch their supply.
