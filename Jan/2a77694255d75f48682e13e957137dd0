A representative of Tibetan Spiritual Leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, Ngodup Dorjee Singchen says the Dalai Lama has extended his sadness, grief and condolences to Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu’s family and the people of South Africa. The Dalai Lama could not attend the 80th Birthday of his close friend Archbishop Desmond Tutu in 2011 as he was denied a visa to come to South Africa. And now he is unable to attend Tutu’s funeral due to the pandemic. Dorjee Singchen is attending the funeral service on behalf of the Dalai Lama at the St Georges Cathedral. “His Holiness the Dalai Lama was not able to come here because of the pandemic. But because of the pandemic and restriction all over the world [he is unable to come]. He has sent his condolences, his sense of grief and sadness to his [Tutu’s] family and the people of South Africa,” he adds. Dorjee Singchen speaks to SABC News:  Below is the live stream of the funeral:
