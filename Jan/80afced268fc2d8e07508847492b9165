Two New Zealand navy vessels carrying water and other supplies will arrive in Tonga on Friday, the first international aid to reach the Pacific island nation reeling from a volcanic eruption and tsunami. Hundreds of homes in Tonga’s smaller outer islands have been destroyed, and at least three people were killed after Saturday’s huge eruption triggered tsunami waves, which rolled over the islands causing what the government has called “an unprecedented disaster”. With communications badly hampered by the severing of an undersea cable, information on the scale of the devastation has mostly come from reconnaissance aircraft. “For the people of Tonga, we’re heading their way now with a whole lot of water,” Simon Griffiths, captain of the HMNZS Aotearoa, said in a release. Griffiths said his ship was carrying 250 000 litres of water, and had the capacity to produce another 70 000 litres a day, along with other supplies. New Zealand’s foreign ministry said the Tongan government has approved the arrival of Aotearoa and the HMNZS Wellington in the COVID-free nation, where concerns about a potential coronavirus outbreak are likely to complicate relief efforts. Tonga has said its water supplies have been contaminated by ash from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano, which erupted with a blast heard 2 300 km (1 430 miles) away in New Zealand. It also sent tsunami waves across the Pacific Ocean. James Garvin, chief scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, said the force of the eruption was estimated to be equivalent to five to 10 megatons of TNT, an explosive force more than 500 times the nuclear bomb dropped by the United States on Hiroshima, Japan, at the end of World War Two. The Red Cross said its teams in Tonga were distributing drinking water across the islands where salt water from the tsunami and volcanic ash were “polluting the clean drinking water sources of tens of thousands of people”. Other countries and agencies including the United Nations are drawing up plans to send aid. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said it would send help, including water, when the archipelago’s main Fua’amotu International Airport is open gain. It was not damaged but was covered in ash, which is being cleared manually, “We thought that it would be operational yesterday, but it hasn’t been fully cleared yet because more ash has been falling,” Fiji-based UN co-ordinator Jonathan Veitch said on Wednesday. A second New Zealand Defence P3 Orion surveillance flight will fly over Tonga and Fiji on Wednesday to assess damage, the foreign ministry said. CLEAN-UP Waves reaching up to 15 metres hit the outer Ha’apia island group, destroying all of the houses on the island of Mango, as well as the west coast of Tonga’s main island, Tongatapu, the prime minister’s office said. On the west coast of Tongatapu, residents were being moved to evacuation centres as 56 houses were destroyed or seriously damaged on that coast. New Zealand said power has now been restored, and clean-up and damage assessments were going on and Tongan authorities were distributing relief supplies. Australia and New Zealand have promised immediate financial assistance. The US Agency for International Development approved $100 000 in immediate assistance to support people affected by volcanic eruptions and tsunami waves. Tongan Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni has met the heads of diplomatic missions to discuss aid, the office said. Tonga is still largely offline after the volcano severed the sole undersea fibre-optics communication cable. International mobile phone network provider Digicel has set up an interim system on Tongatapu using the University of South Pacific’s satellite dish, the New Zealand foreign ministry said. That would allow a 2G connection to be established but the connection is patchy and amounts to about 10% of usual capacity, US cable company SubCom has advised it will take at least four weeks for Tonga’s cable connection to be repaired, it added. REMOTE AID Tongan communities abroad posted new images received from families back home on Facebook, giving a glimpse into the extent of the devastation. The images show homes reduced to rubble, fallen trees, cracked roads and sidewalks and grey ash everywhere. Aid agencies, including the United Nations, are preparing to get relief supplies to Tonga at a distance to avoid introducing the coronavirus, Veitch said. Tonga is one of the few countries that is COVID-19 free and an outbreak there would disastrous, he said. “We believe that we will be able to send flights with supplies. We’re not sure that we can send flights with personnel and the reason for this is that Tonga has a very strict COVID-free policy,” Veitch told a briefing. “They’ve been very cautious about opening their borders like many Pacific islands, and that’s because of the history of disease outbreaks in the Pacific which has wiped out societies here.”
