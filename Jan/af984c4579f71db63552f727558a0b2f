Cape Town Fire Services are still at Parliament monitoring any possible flare-ups. A small team with two fire engines are constantly checking that the fire is completely extinguished before handing the site over to the police and the Department of Public Works to start their investigations. The fire was finally contained on Tuesday after it flared up several times between Sunday morning and Monday evening. Parliament spokesperson Moloto Mothapo has urged South Africans not to worry about the safety of documents as most of them have been digitized. “We are happy that the library has not been destroyed. It’s a great repository of historical documents, we are happy that the art gallery has not been destroyed, we are happy the paintings and historical pictures remain safe. The Keiskama artwork also remains safe. Those are some of the things that give us light at the end of the tunnel.” SABC News reporter Abra Barbier updates from Parliament:  Firefighters were today thanked by government officials during a ceremony at the Roeland Street Fire Station. Cape Town Mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis thanked firefighters who battled the fire at Parliament. Hill-Lewis also pledged the City’s support for the reconstruction of Parliament. “What we wanted to do was to come and just say a very simple thing, thank you for going above and beyond and for doing your jobs with absolute professionalism, with dedication, with commitment to our city and to our country and for trying as best as you could to save as much of Parliament as possible,” says Hill-Lewis.
