The architect of the National Assembly building, Jack van der Lecq says the most critical part to rebuilding is to test the structural integrity of the building. Van der Lecq is the person who designed the building as early as 1984 and the building was completed and opened in 1988. Mercedes Besent speaks to the architect:  Van der Lecq explains, “The most critical thing for me is the testing of the structural integrity of the building because over the main Assembly Chamber there are six massive beams spanning over the total width of that chamber. And if there is any damage or deflection or cracking or whatever structural system, then we have got another problem. Then of course it has to be redone and that’s a totally different story. Point number one, the structural integrity of the building must be tested.” Alternative venue for State of the Nation Address President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to deliver the State of the Nation Address in February, which happens in the National Assembly. With the building now gutted, an alternative venue has to be found to host the hundreds of politicians and guests that normally attend the event.
