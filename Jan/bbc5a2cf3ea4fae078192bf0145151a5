Firefighters are attending to a fire on the Matroosberg mountain in De Doorns in the Cape Winelands. Municipality spokesperson Jo-Anne Otto says the fire broke out on Friday as the result of a lightning strike. There is currently no threat to life or property and no injuries have been reported. Otto says the fire has been partially contained. “The fire has been mostly contained but teams are being trooped in by helicopter to the higher areas which are inaccessible by vehicle to continue with firefighting activities on active fire lines. Then also with mopping up and operational activities. The area is mostly made up of indigenous vegetation interspersed with a few pines which do add to the fuel load.” Firefighters hand over Parliament’s fire report Meanwhile, Cape Town firefighters officially handed over the fire-damaged Parliament building to the Hawks for investigations. The Presiding Officers of Parliament, led by the Speaker of the National Assembly, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, and the Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) Amos Masondo, are satisfied with the overall progress made on the containment of fire and the investigations currently underway at the precinct of Parliament.
