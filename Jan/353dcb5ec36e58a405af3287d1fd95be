“We have a big problem with sewer, especially in the locations. This thing is not good at all like in the three houses behind me, sewer is spilling into the houses.” “We are working on an immediate plan to deal with these spillages. But also, the executive mayor in his 100 days program will be dealing with the long-term infrastructure challenges that are there in the city. We want to assure the community of Mangaung that this is the matter that is receiving the utmost attention. We understand that the hygiene of the community is highly affected, and we want to apologize. All the inquiries that are brought to the attention of the city are being attended to.”
