Political analyst Professor Tinyiko Maluleke says that Tourism Minister Lindiwe Sisulu’s article should have been ignored because it lacks insight. Sisulu wrote an article in which she questioned the moral standing of judges and criticised the constitution. She referred to unnamed black judges as mentally colonised Africans who had settled for the mindset of those who had dispossessed their ancestors. Professor Maluleke says the article does not deserve the public outrage that it has received. “I can’t help but think that we are overreacting. I don’t think she intended that. She probably just wanted to air her views. But Justice Zondo has every right, even in his current position as Acting Chief Justice, to respond and probably his fellow judges have even prevailed upon him to say something. I think this article could have been ignored.” In a contrasting view, Political analyst Ongama Mtimka says South Africans will begin to ask whether some politicians plan to leave a legacy of strengthening or weakening democracy in their process of campaigning. Mtimka says the whole saga is deeply worrying. “When we continue to allow politicians in powerful positions to have a free rein on the institutional integrity with substance, then we are allowing ourselves to get on very dangerous terrain. So, she must campaign all she wants. The writing is quite good, and she quotes my favourite economist, but it’s in bad faith as far as I’m concerned.” Meanwhile, Sisulu has since said she is in consultation with her legal team following Zondo’s response.
