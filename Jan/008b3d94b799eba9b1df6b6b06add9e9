An incident in which an aeroplane door was ripped off at the Cape Town International Airport is under investigation. A British Airways plane’s door reportedly became detached when it was left open during a routine towing. Regional General Manager for the Cape Town International Airport Cluster, Mark Maclean says repairs are underway after the damage was sustained to the aircraft door and the Passenger Loading Bridge. No one was injured during the incident as the crew and passengers had already disembarked. Maclean says they will be taking the necessary corrective action to prevent future incidents.
