African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Pemmy Majodina has suspended party MP Mervyn Dirks
who wanted President Cyril Ramaphosa to account to parliament’s watchdog body on public accounts – SCOPA. Majodina has also stripped Dirks of all powers as an MP and gagged him from speaking to the media on the matter. This, after Dirks refused Majodina’s order to withdraw his letter to Scopa asking for the committee to summon Ramaphosa to appear before it to explain his remarks in a leaked recording that public funds were used in ANC campaigns. But Dirks told Majodina that as a member of parliament he was bound by his oath to be obedient to the Constitution and hold the executive to account. He then asked Majodina to explain how his call for Scopa to hold Ramaphosa accountable was in conflict with his oath as an MP. On Thursday, Dirks was slapped with a suspension letter by the ANC Chief Whip. Scopa will discuss the matter on Friday morning. Dirks has now been suspended as an ANC member of Scopa and kicked out from the ANC Caucus WhatsApp group. He’s also being prevented from speaking to the media. He will be called before a disciplinary hearing within the next seven days. Political commentator Oliver Dickson shares more on the issue:
