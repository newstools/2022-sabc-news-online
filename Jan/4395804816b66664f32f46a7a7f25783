It is set to be a busy week for the African National Congress (ANC), with a regular two-day National Executive Committee meeting starting on Thursday until Friday followed by its National Executive Council Lekgotla from Saturday until Sunday. This comes at the end of its National Working Committee which ended on Monday. The two meetings will finalise plans for the year 2022 based on the priorities and tasks set out in the ANC January 8 Statement. The ANC NEC Lekgotla takes place twice a year in January and July. It brings together alliance partners and ANC deployees at national, provincial, and local spheres of government as well as in strategic sectors of society including business, civil society, and traditional leaders. The bi-annual Lekgotla is normally called to review government programmes and to make input into governance priorities for the year. The Saturday NEC Lekgotla will reflect on the Economic Recovery and Reconstruction Plan, the provision of basic services to all South Africans citizens, and the creation of jobs and alleviation of poverty among others. The regular NEC meeting on the other hand will focus on organisational renewal and adopt a roadmap towards the ANC 55th National Conference planned for December.
