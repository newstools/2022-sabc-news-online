Some 2021 matriculants at the Mbilwi Secondary School, in the Vhembe district, Limpopo have blamed the decline in the school’s pass rate on the COVID-19 pandemic. The school obtained a 76.8% pass rate, which is a decline of about 9% compared to 2020. Some matriculants say the shortened learning programme contributed to poor performance. “Coronavirus has a lot to do with things in our schools. We are trying to study and most of the time, while we studying, we can’t go to school – like full hours,” says a student. “The virus really disturbed us since Grade 11. It was really bad and we couldn’t study any more. We could blame this on the virus because we had less schools hours and we used to attend from 7 am until 11 am,” says another student. On Friday, Limpopo Education MEC Polly Boshielo also said the matric class of 2021 has suffered the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to poor matric results.

The province is sitting at 66,7%, a decline of 1.5% from the previous year. Releasing the provincial matric results in Polokwane on Friday, Boshielo said pre-existing learning deficits, that may have existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 also had an impact on learning and teaching.
