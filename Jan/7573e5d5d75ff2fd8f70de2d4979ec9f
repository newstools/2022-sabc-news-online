Free State Police, Roads and Transport MEC William Bulwane says there’s a need to beef up security at the SABC’s premises in Bloemfontein. This comes after a 27-year-old man was shot and wounded in a stand-off with security guards. The suspect, who is currently under police guard in hospital, was found in possession of several suspicious items. Bulwane says adequate measures will be put in place to address the apparent security breach. “We have seen, we have investigated. There are a number of things that security were not in compliance with. The General (Free State Police Commissioner Baile Motswenyane) and the management of the SABC here in Bloemfontein will work on them, including our team.” Case of attempted murder Police say they are legally required to investigate a case of attempted murder against the security officer who shot and wounded the man. Operations were briefly disrupted after the building was evacuated for bomb sweeping. Free State police spokesperson, Motantsi Makhele, says there’s nothing untoward with the investigation against the security guard. “There must be a case open so that an investigation can prove that was in self defence or a crime has been committed. So, even in this incident, there was a requirement that we must adhere in accordance with what the prescribed case to be opened, thoroughly be investigated. But that doesn’t mean that anybody is in trouble until the whole investigation is concluded.” The Hawks in the Free State say investigations are under way following the incident. Several suspicious parcels were reportedly seized from the suspect following the involvement of the Hawks and police’s bomb squad unit. The suspect had also allegedly covered corridor walls with graffiti. Police are also investigating a separate case after a Facebook user allegedly incited the public to burn the Lesedi FM offices.
