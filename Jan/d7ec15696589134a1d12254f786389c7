Several military vehicles were seen driving on the roads on Thursday evening in the Russian-controlled Crimean peninsula. Video obtained by Reuters shows the military vehicles thought to be missile launcher vehicles moving in Sevastopol, the base of the Russian Black Sea navy, which has in its arsenal the Bastion coastal missile defence system. Russia seized and annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and has been considered areas around the peninsula’s coast to be Russian waters. Western countries deem Crimea part of Ukraine and reject Russia’s claim to its seas. On January 25, Russian Defence Ministry said it has started making combat readiness inspections in its southern military district that, according to the Ministry, includes Crimea. The Kremlin earlier said it was watching with great concern after the United States put 8 500 troops on alert to be ready to deploy to Europe in case of an escalation in the Ukraine crisis. Tensions are high after Russia massed an estimated 100 000 troops in reach of Ukraine’s border. Russia denies planning an invasion. But having surrounded Ukraine with forces from the north, east and south, Moscow is now citing the Western response as evidence that Russia is the target, not the instigator, of aggression.
