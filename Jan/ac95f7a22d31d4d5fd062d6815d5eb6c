The High Court in Pretoria has reversed the Basic Education Department’s decision not to publish the National Senior Certificate results in the media. Lobby group AfriForum, Maroela Media and a 2021 matriculant Anlé Spies served court papers on Minister Angie Motshekga last week. The organisation fought for matric results to be released on media platforms as was the case in the past. Matric results will be released on Thursday this week. Afriforum Kallie Kriel says this is a victory for all involved especially last year’s matrics. Discussion on AfriForum’s urgent court application to have matric results publicly released  Earlier on Tuesday, AfriForum’s Kriel told SABC News that the decision will have a detrimental effect on a number of stakeholders. “Other arguments also remain, that you should have hype about the media release of these results. We believe it is good, it motivates students so that they work hard at the beginning of the year. After their matric, you have the top learners that are also being published but that also won’t happen,” says Kriel. “We believe [that] if you look at the top learners being published, it’s also a motivation for younger students to also get that kind of achievement and also the recognition,” adds Kriel.
