The latest Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index shows that South Africa’s fight against corruption has stagnated over the last ten years. The index shows that South Africa, along with many other countries, has reached a virtual standstill in its efforts to fight corruption. In 2012, South Africa scored 43, ranking 69 out of 176 countries. In 2021 the country scored 44, dropping one place in rank to 70 out of the now 180 countries. The highest index score over the past decade was 45 in 2016, while the lowest score was 42 on the 2013 index. Corruption Watch legal researcher Mashudu Masutha says, “The country has unfortunately either declined and has made no significant progress since 2012. This illustrates that South Africa over the last ten years has been unable to manage the systemic issues of corruption and particularly in the public sector.” “Because the Corruption Perceptions Index looks at political and administrative corruption of the public sector, these findings of South Africa remaining stagnant over the last ten years means the country is unable to prioritise anti-corruption and place it high on the national agenda,” adds Masutha. The Corruption Perceptions Index 2021 shows that countries that violate civil liberties consistently score lower on fighting corruption.  Check out our analysis  https://t.co/YvtVQHnSg5
