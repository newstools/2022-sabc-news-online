Political analyst Levy Ndou says the January 8 Statement address which African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa will deliver at the Old Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane  should focus on what ordinary citizens are experiencing. Ramaphosa is set to deliver the January 8 Statement in celebration of the ANC’s 110th anniversary. Ndou says the ANC can only regain public confidence if it begins to relate what the grassroots are going through. “Issues relating to service delivery, not only security, on a daily basis. Maybe I must also remind you that last night I also had a power cut. So, this talks to the day-to-day challenges which relate to how government is supposed to improve in the delivery of services to our people. That for me is a situation that the ANC would like to forget about but a sufficient explanation should be required.” January 8 Statement I ANC celebrates its 110th anniversary this Saturday in Polokwane  Ramaphosa says the strategy to renew and rebuild the ANC was agreed on during Thursday’s National Executive Committee meeting. “The ANC NEC has agreed to intensify and accelerate renewal focusing more energy on renewal and rebuilding, which should be based on some key pillars that include building ANC branches as agents of change with a membership that respects and is respected by the people – but we also want to build a more youthful organisation.” On Friday, Ramaphosa hailed the former African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) leader Peter Mokaba as a gallant leader of the struggle.
