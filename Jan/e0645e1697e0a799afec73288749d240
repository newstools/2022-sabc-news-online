The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) says it has received applications from six mobile operators to take part in the auctioning of high-demand spectrum in March 2022. This after Telkom took a decision to withdraw its urgent application to interdict for the auctioning of the spectrum. The applicants for the spectrum include Cell C, MTN, Vodacom, Telkom, Rain and Liquid Telecoms. In a statement, ICASA says it will announce the qualified bidders on 21 February 2022 with bidding scheduled for the 8th of March. Telkom is among the list of applicants that would be bidding for the high-demand spectrum. But the company will continue to challenge the design of the auction process issued by ICASA. It has argued that current process will entrench an uneven playing in the sector. The outcome of the review case could derail the auctioning process if the court rules in favour of Telkom.  The review case is expected to be heard on 1st – 4th March. Icasa has urged all role players to align their interests with their patriotic spirit. Telkom withdraws interdict to stop ICASA from auctioning frequency spectrum: Siyabonga Mahlangu:
