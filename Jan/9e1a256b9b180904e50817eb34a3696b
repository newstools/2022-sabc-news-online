Political analyst Dr Reggie Makgoba says the disbandment of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) structures in Limpopo was inevitable. Party leader, Julius Malema, announced the disbandment of all structures in the province following a relatively poor showing in the last local government elections. Malema defended the party’s decision, saying they can’t tolerate leaders who are lazy and therefore action needed to be taken. The EFF’s voter support percentage declined from 16.73% in the 2016 local government elections to 14.27% in last year’s local government elections. Malema has tasked senior party member Mbuyiseni Ndlozi to lead the province and regional conferences. Makgoba says unity between the interim structure will be crucial for the party’s survival. “They got distracted somewhere and maybe because they thought that Malema is from Limpopo, that’s good enough a message to get it out there but that’s not enough. You still have to go to the ground and speak to the people and it’s not something that you do as a by the way. It’s something that requires a concrete strategy that you go to the people. You remind them that this is what the EFF stands for, and this is what we’re going to do we’re going to government,” adds Makgoba.
