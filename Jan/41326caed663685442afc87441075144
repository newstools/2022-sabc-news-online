The succession battle for the AmaZulu throne continues in the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Tuesday. Late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini’s first wife Queen Sibongile Dlamini-Zulu and her daughters, Princesses Ntandoyenkosi Zulu and Ntombizosuthu Zulu-Duma are challenging the validity of his will. The late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini died in March 2021. The will names Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu as the Regent following the King’s death. It also gave her the authority to name the successor. In this light, King Misuzulu kaZwelithini was named as the successor. Dlamini-Zulu is approaching the court to recognise her civil marriage to the late King, in terms of the Marriage Act of 1961. In her founding affidavit, she states that while she never entered into a customary marriage, she feels she has been subjected to it without consent. In a separate application, her daughters – Princesses Ntandoyenkosi Zulu and Ntombizosuthu Zulu-Duma- are challenging the validity of the King’s will. In court papers, they state that the signatures in the will differ from the known and genuine signatures of the late King. It is in this regard that they are asking the court to nullify this copy of the will. The video below is reporting on the royal battle:  Meanwhile, various family members of the AmaZulu Royal household have arrived at court accompanied by regiments and maidens as the succession battle for the throne continues. Outside court, the maidens are singing traditional songs and carrying placards in solidarity with King Misuzulu kaZwelithini whose nomination as the next King is being challenged. Founder of Unomkhubulwane Insititute Dr Nomagugu Ngobese is among those in support of King Misuzulu. The main road leading to court has been closed to traffic. Security inside and outside court has also been beefed up.
