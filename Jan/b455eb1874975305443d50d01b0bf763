Opposition parties in Mpumalanga have sent condolences to the Malatjie’s family following the passing of the Executive Mayor of EMalahleni Linah Malatjie. Malatjie passed away in an accident that happened on the R544 road near Gemsbok in the early hours of Monday. It is alleged Malatjie was from the birthday celebration of the Nkangala African National Congress (ANC) regional chair and the MEC for Human Settlement, Speedy Mashilo, in Suncity near KwaMhlanga. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Mpumalanga said Malatjie never discriminated other party members according to their affiliations. “As the EFF, we are an official opposition in the council, and we were expecting a lot from the executive. We were expecting more from her, and we learned a lot from her,” said a representative from the EFF. The DA says: “As the DA, we are saddened about the death of our mother the executive mayor, Linah Malatjie. Everyone would know that Malatjie was able to work with everyone without considering the political affiliation. She had a good working relationship with everyone. She loved peace and was caring to the public.” Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga says it has lost a pillar of strength following the death of the mayor. The party says the mayor and her husband Esau Malatjie died on the scene of the crash. I’ve been updated on the terrible news of the passing of Emalahleni Mayor, Mrs Linah Malatjie & her husband. They were involved in a head on crash that resulted in 3 fatalities – authorities are investigating. I send my condolences to their families, these are terrible news. — FIKILE MBALULA | MR FIX (@MbalulaFikile) January 3, 2022  eMalahleni Mayor dies in car crash:
