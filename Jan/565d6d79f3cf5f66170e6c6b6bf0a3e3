A parolee who has been convicted in the High Court, in Cape Town, on charges of kidnapping, rape and murder of a young boy will be sentenced on Thursday. Jacobus Petoors was convicted following the murder of eight-year-old, Reagan Gertse, from Tulbagh in the Boland in February 2020. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Spokesperson, Eric Ntabazalila says Petoors was out on parole for a few months when he committed the crimes. Previously, Petoors was convicted on 24 July 2012 for rape and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, which he committed on 29 October 2011. He was sentenced to 12-year imprisonment and was released on parole, only three months before he committed the heinous crimes against Gertse. The child’s murder prompted Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola to call an urgent meeting of senior parole board officials.
