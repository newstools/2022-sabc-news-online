Firefighters are battling a huge blaze in the Parliament precinct in Cape Town. Some of the buildings under threat include the National Council of Provinces (NCOP) building and the Old Assembly Chamber. The cause of the blaze is still unclear. The fire is reportedly beginning to subside at the building where it seems to have broken out – the Old Assembly Chamber. The smoke was grey, black and white. The City’s JP Smith says the City Fire and Rescue Services received the call at 05:03 am of a building alight in Parliament Avenue. “Roeland Street Fire was first on scene and with the assessment of the fire more resources were called. We currently have 6 firefighting appliances and approximately 36 firefighters on scene,” says Smith. He says the fire is currently on the 3rd floor – initial reports indicate it started in the office space and is spreading toward the gymnasium. The roof area has caught alight and the National Assembly building is also on fire. The fire has not been contained and reports of cracks in some walls of the building have been confirmed. pic.twitter.com/APwdmW35NH — JS_Bond (@_JS_Bond_) January 2, 2022
