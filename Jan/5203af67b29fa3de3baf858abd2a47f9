The South African Editors’ Forum (SANEF) says the non-publication of the 2021 matric results will pose as a financial setback for the print media industry. SANEF Executive Director, Reggy Moalusi says print media houses had already pre-ordered and paid for their printing paper before the decision to not publish the results was made. Moalusi says SANEF is disappointed with the Department of Basic Education for not consulting them in the non-publication decision. “The decision was unfortunate and disappointing. We didn’t expect such a decision from the department. But following our meeting that we had with them, they apologised [for] not consulting with us,” says Moalusi. “Moreover, after the introduction of the Protection of Personal Information Act (Popia), in the middle of last year, there’s three litigants and SANEF is not one of them. It took the department to court,” says Moalusi. “That matter is being heard, but we are quite hopeful that has the department has promised to not oppose any decision should the court rule in favour of those litigants, we will also welcome it,” adds Moalusi. Discussion on whether to publish or not to publish in the media:  Meanwhile, AfriForum CEO Kallie Kriel says the decision will have a detrimental effect on a number of stakeholders. “Other arguments also remain, that you should have hype about the media release of these results. We believe it is good, it motivates students so that they work hard at the beginning of the year. After their matric, you have the top learners that are also being published but that also won’t happen,” says Kriel. “We believe [that] if you look at the top learners being published, it’s also a motivation for younger students to also get that kind of achievement and also the recognition,” adds Kriel.
