City of Cape Town Mayoral Committee Member for Economic Opportunities, James Vos says local economy will continue to suffer as long as lockdown regulations including curfew apply. Vos says the tourism industry which created 113 000 direct jobs before the pandemic he believes close to 50% jobs were scaled down. He says the uplifting of curfew is a positive step towards the right direction. Authorities are currently conducting research on the Night-Time Economic study in order to see how it can activate a 24-hour activity. “The uplifting of the curfew will save a lot of our businesses. In the many months that we have been calling for an end to curfew, I heard from small businesses and traders across Cape Town how they need possible hours of trading to make an income and better pay their stuff,” says Vos. Cape Town businesses fear they might never recover if life does not return to normal
