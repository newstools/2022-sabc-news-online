Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has cleared former Gauteng Economic Development MEC Lebogang Maile of allegations of corruption in the leasing of a Johannesburg building at R1.3 million per month. The Marshalltown building houses some of the department’s entities that include the Gauteng Growth Development Agency and the Liquor Board. The complaint was launched in June 2019 by then the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Gauteng leader, Mandisa Mashego who alleged that the building was overpriced and that the agreement was signed without following prescribed procurement processes. Mkhwebane was releasing a number of investigation reports. “We found all the allegations unsubstantiated. There was no evidence indicating that Mr Maile signed or extended a lease agreement on behalf of the agreement. As the agreement was concluded in February 2009 and certain clauses were amended as per addendum signed in April 2011. This was prior to Mr Maile being appointed MEC for Economic Development,” says Mkhwebane. VIDEO: Public Protector Adv Busisiwe Mkhwebane on outcomes of recent investigations:
