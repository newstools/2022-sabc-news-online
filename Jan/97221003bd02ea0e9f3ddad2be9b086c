The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) and Fly SAX have called on the Department of Public Enterprises and the provisional liquidators of SA Express to finalise its sale. The state-owned airline has been in provisional liquidation for almost two years after business rescue processes failed.

We have to at least try and salvage it in order for them to have a prospective future. We don’t understand who stands to benefit from this airline not continuing its journey with the employees at the helm.” “This is why we are fighting so hard for this deal to be finalised. There is an offer on the table, stop ignoring this offer, finalise it and let’s get on with creating employment for the employees that have been left destitute by the actions of the government,” Nsibanyoni-Mugambi says.
