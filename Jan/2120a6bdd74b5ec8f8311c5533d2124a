President Cyril Ramaphosa has described as concerning, the acts of vandalism at the Constitutional Court in Braamfontein, Johannesburg. A 36-year-old man has been arrested after he allegedly used a hammer to smash windows at the Constitutional Court buildings. Ramaphosa says he is yet to be briefed by the relevant Ministers on the matter but says it is a real concern for the country. It is not yet clear whether the incident has anything to do with the release of the first part of the State Capture Commission report by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, on Tuesday.  #sapsHQ Police arrested a 36-year-old suspect following an incident on Wednesday morning where police responded to reports of a man breaking the windows using a hammer, at the Constitutional Court buildings in Braamfontein, Johannesburg.
