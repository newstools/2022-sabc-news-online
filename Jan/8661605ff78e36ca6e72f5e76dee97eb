A suspect arrested after he was allegedly found breaking the windows of the Constitutional Court with a hammer is expected to appear in the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg on Friday morning. The 36-year-old man has been charged with malicious damage to property. He was arrested on Wednesday after he allegedly ignored police orders to stop. Officers then fired a warning shot to force the man to desist from breaking the windows. Judicial transparency watchdog “Judges Matter” says the attack undermines the judiciary and democracy. It has called on law enforcement agencies to take urgent steps to protect the country’s national key points.

Ramaphosa says he is yet to be briefed by the relevant Ministers on the matter but says it is a real concern for the country. It is not yet clear whether the incident has anything to do with the release of the first part of the State Capture Commission report by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, on Tuesday.
