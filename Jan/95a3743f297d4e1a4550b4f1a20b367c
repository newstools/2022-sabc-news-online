The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) has welcomed confirmation of the R7.9-million interim preservation order in the Anglo Gold Ashanti Hospital matter. The SIU investigation has revealed that the Gauteng Department of Health and the Gauteng Department of Infrastructure Development, jointly irregularly awarded contracts for the refurbishment of the hospital near Carletonville to various professional service providers and contractors. The investigation revealed that the lease of the Hospital and the appointment of contractors were irregular and unlawful. The total value of the refurbishments increased from an estimated R50-million to approximately R500-million. “The SIU would like to welcome the special tribunal judgment dismissing the application to reconsider and set aside a R7.9 million interim preservation order that was granted to the Special Investigating Unit on 17 September 2021, in a matter between SIU and Pro Serve Consulting Ltd and Thenga Holding Ltd, pending the final determination of a review application that the SIU instituted on 14 December 2021 in the Special Tribunal for the review and setting aside of a number of contracts associated with the lease and refurbishment of the Anglo Gold Ashanti Hospital near Carletonville for use during the Covid-19 pandemic,” SIU spokesperson Kaizer Kganyago explains.
