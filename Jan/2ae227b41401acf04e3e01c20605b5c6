NGO Judges Matter has condemned the attack on the Constitutional Court in Braamfontein by a hammer-wielding man earlier today. Police say the man was arrested after being caught breaking the court’s windows with the hammer. Investigations are under way to determine the motive behind the incident. The suspect will appear in court soon. Research and Advocacy Officer at Judges Matter, Mbekezeli Benjamin says, “As Judges Matter, we are extremely worried that there could be such an attack on the Constitutional Court building, which is a National Key Point that should be given 24-hour security. The fact that a person could attack the highest court in the land is of grave concern for the judiciary and democracy as a whole. So, as Judges Matter, we call on the law enforcement authorities to act swiftly, arrest and prosecute those responsible.” The suspect was caught red-handed by police while breaking windows at the court with a hammer. At this stage, it’s unknown what the motive behind the incident was. Gauteng Police Spokesperson Robert Netshiunda says, “We can confirm that police received information that there was a man who was breaking windows at the Concourt in Braamfontein using a hammer. When police arrived, the man continued breaking the windows and he was ordered to stop but he continued. A warning shot was apparently fired and he was arrested. He will appear in court soon.”
