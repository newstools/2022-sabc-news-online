The Commission for Gender Equality says urgency is necessary in the probe into claims of serious misconduct against suspended Western Cape MEC for safety and security Albert Fritz. While media reports have circulated that the allegations are linked to sexual assault, Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has not yet publicly divulged the nature of the allegations. Commission spokesperson Jabu Baloyi says, “The matter has gone past the party. The Premier of the Western Cape has done what he was supposed to do … with two of the alleged victims of the sexual assault or sexual misconduct of MEC Fritz.” “We will want to hear what it is that they have to say. But we believe that the party must just leave the police to do what they are supposed to do. Because parallel processes that will be running, will be unnecessary. The police will do justice,” explains Baloyi. An independent investigation is under way and is expected to be completed in the next few days. Winde says he will only release details of the complainants once they give him permission to do so.

Leader of the opposition in the legislature, Cameron Dugmore says, “Were these reasons about personal conduct? Were they about issues connected to his role as the MEC? The public has the right to know and we as the ANC in the Western Cape Legislature are insisting that the Premier come clean with the legislature and the Western Cape community as a whole and give us the reasons for this sudden suspension. We want to know and the public deserves to know.” Below is the ANC statement reacting to Fritz’s suspension:
