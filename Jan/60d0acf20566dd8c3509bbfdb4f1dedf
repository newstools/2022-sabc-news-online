Instability continues at the troubled Phokwane municipality in the Northern Cape and has adversely affected service delivery. Problems within the municipality have been coming on since 2018. In a recent move, the African National Congress’s Frances Baard Region expelled the mayor – saying he is working with the opposition. The endless chaos in this council has seen residents going weeks without water, with refuse uncollected and sewage flowing on the streets. Two months after the local government elections, the municipality is hit by another court battle and expulsion of the new mayor. Mayor, Olebogeng Tumodi has been expelled by the ANC for misconduct. The party accuses him of failing to attend a caucus meeting during an inaugural council meeting. It further says he acted in collaboration with other political parties on council matters. However, despite the party expulsion, the mayor remains in office. “The mayor is still in office and we will appeal. For me it’s about the needs of community members,” says Michael Setlhogomi,  Phokwane Service Delivery Forum. Meanwhile, in December – three days before Tumodi’s appointment as mayor, chaos erupted in chambers. However, with all these troubles it’s residents who are at the receiving end – leaving some frustrated. “There should not be political interference, but the council needs to do things on their own,” says Pampierstad resident, Itumeleng Mokwa. Pampierstad resident Lydia Sebipidi says, “There is no service delivery in our area.” “These issues are affecting us badly. You can see how these roads look like. Political parties should stay out of government matters,” says another resident Tidimalo Maruping. In a statement, the ANC’s Frances Baard region says they found Tumodi guilty in terms of rule 25.21.7 of the ANC constitution. It says he has 21-days to appeal the outcome to the provincial disciplinary structure.
