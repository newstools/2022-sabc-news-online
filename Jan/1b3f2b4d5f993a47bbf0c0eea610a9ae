Three people who died in a collision between a minibus-taxi and an SUV which claimed 17 lives have been laid to rest at Lebowakgomo in Limpopo. They were killed nearly three weeks ago on the N1 near Mookgophong when their taxi burst into flames. Other grieving families buried their loved ones during the week. The remains of 33-year-old Sina Valoyi and her two children were handed back to the family last week. The Valoyi family spokesperson, Maurice Petje, says they are still struggling to come to terms with the deaths. “It is devastating. The experience that we had has shut down the whole family, we never expected it and losing three people at a go is a mess and the mother as you can see, she is not coping it is hard. She has been hard-hit, the whole family is in shock,” says Petje. Petje has also expressed gratitude for the support shown by the community and the Limpopo government. “We want to thank our provincial leadership for really assisting us. We were really panicking because such cases take a long time to get closure. What they have done, I should think they need a pat on their shoulders because there are a lot of people waiting for their DNA results but we didn’t wait for more than a month, we just waited for two weeks,” says Petje.
