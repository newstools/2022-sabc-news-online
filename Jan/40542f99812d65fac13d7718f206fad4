I knew I did well but not this well. I feel very special, it feels so unreal. Knowing that we are part of that elite group makes us feel like we can do anything. I’m planning on studying computer science and applied mathematics at UCT.” “I am grateful for what the Department of Education has done for me and it’s going to be memorable. My plans for this year, I would like to study electrical engineering.” 2021 National Senior Certificate Examination Results announcement:
