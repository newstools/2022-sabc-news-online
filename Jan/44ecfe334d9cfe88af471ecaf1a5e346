Tertiary institutions in KwaZulu-Natal are encouraging students to apply online for the 2022 academic year. This is due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Institutes of higher learning will also not be accepting walk-in applications. Parents and prospective students are therefore urged not to visit university campuses. The Durban University of Technology (DUT) says its registration processes started earlier this month. Due to the pandemic and regulations being put in place to curb its spread, DUT says it will continue to have registrations online and off-campus. The university says it is also not accepting walk-ins. Similarly, the University of KwaZulu-Natal has also emphasised that registration for the 2022 academic year is strictly online. This is to mitigate any possible health risks to staff and students.
