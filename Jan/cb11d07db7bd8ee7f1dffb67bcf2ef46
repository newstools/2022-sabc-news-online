ActionSA leader Herman Mashaba has sent a strong message to Lily Mine management, Business Rescue Practitioners and the government that justice should prevail. Mashaba addressed the former mineworkers and the affected families during an event to mark one thousand days since some family members started to camp outside the mine premises. Pretty Nkambule, Yvonne Mnisi and Solomon Nyirenda were working inside a container that was buried when the mine collapsed in February 2016. The families of the deceased have been pressuring the authorities to resume the search operation, which was stopped due to safety concerns. Mashaba says criminal charges will be instituted against those who are behind the disaster. “One message I really want our government, the owners of this mine and business rescue practitioners [to know], I want them to know [this] very clear message. Yes we want the container to come out so that the families [can] see closure for the burial of their loved ones.” “But [that] is not going to be the end, we would make sure that we put the government responsible to ensure that peruse criminal charges against everyone who played a role in hiding this matte and ensuring that the families have suffered the last six years,” explains Mashaba.
