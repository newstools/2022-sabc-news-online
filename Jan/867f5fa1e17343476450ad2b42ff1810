The north and the southbound carriageways on the N2 north of Durban, near Queen Nandi Drive, have now been opened. However, this excludes the fast lane in both directions. Traffic came to a standstill on Tuesday morning when a fuel tanker carrying 49 litres of paraffin overturned. It is alleged that the truck driver lost control and overturned after colliding with a motorbike and a bakkie. The motorbike driver was the only one injured in this incident.
