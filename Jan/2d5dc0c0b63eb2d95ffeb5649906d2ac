Residents of Tshiame near Harrismith in the Free State say they are fed up with empty promises that their electricity will be restored soon. They have been without power for five weeks. The Maluti-A-Phofung Municipality says the lightning that struck the substation in December, caused the power outage. Life has become uncomfortable for residents of Tshiame. Nearby Makholokoeng village has also been affected. The residents have had to survive without electricity since 22 December. “We cannot do anything, especially for the young children. In the morning, I have to warm water for them and we struggle to do that. I have to use the paraffin heater and it takes time because I have to do it outside.” Another resident says: “It is very dark at night, so the crime is high. So, we are suffering because we cannot see anyone who is entering our house.” Maluti-A-Phofung Executive Mayor, Gilbert Mokotso, acknowledges there have been delays in the restoration of power. “It was during December and the factories were closed, so we didn’t get the material on time. Then we started getting the material during January, the second week, 9 January. It takes so long because of that problem.” Mokotso says they will only be able to quantify how much they have spent once power has been fully restored. In the meantime, residents have to manage their daily lives without power.
