Gauteng police have re-arrested two of the six inmates who escaped while on the way to court at Vosloorus in Ekurhuleni. They were arrested in Olivenhoutbosch, Centurion, on Friday evening. A third suspect was also arrested for aiding and abetting the fugitives. The six suspects escaped after the police truck they were travelling in was ambushed by three armed men driving a silver vehicle. The incident occurred at the corner of Barry Marais and Rondebult streets. Police spokesperson Brenda Muridili says, “A task team that was established immediately after the escape of six prisoners has been working around the clock to assure that the 6 are recaptured. Yesterday the team made a breakthrough when they rearrested Nkomo and Hlatswayo in Pretoria, Olivenhoutbosch. The provincial commissioner has thanked the public for all the tip-offs that the police received on the fugitives.”
