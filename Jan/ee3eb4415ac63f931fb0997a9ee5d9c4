The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga says it has lost a pillar of strength following the death of Emalahleni Mayor Linah Malatjie in a car crash. The party says the mayor and her husband died on the scene of the crash which happened when they were travelling in their private vehicle on Monday morning. “The family of Malatjie was travelling in their private car and unfortunately both of them succumbed to their injuries. This is very sad news that we are communicating and informing formally the Mpumalanga province and also the community of Emalahleni because mam Linah Malatjie was serving the second term as the executive major of Emalahleni. She was also the PEC member of ANC in Mpumalanga. They lost their lives due to a head-on collision,” says Lindiwe Ntshalintshali, ANC provincial acting secretary. Emalahleni Municipality Executive Mayor Linah Malatjie passed on after being involved in a accident this morning. pic.twitter.com/BSmSkGY3zw — Difference Lubisi (@DifferenceSA) January 3, 2022  Emalahleni Mayor Linah Malatjie passes away in a car crash
