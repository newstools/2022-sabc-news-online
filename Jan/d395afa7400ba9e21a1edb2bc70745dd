ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa says State Capture was a systematic attempt to syphon off public resources and funds. He was delivering the ANC’s January 8th statement at the Old Peter Mokaba stadium in Polokwane as part of the party’s 110th birthday celebrations. ANC January 8th Statement 2022:  Ramaphosa received the first part of the State Capture report from acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo earlier this week. Some described the release of the report as a defining moment in the country’s history and a step forward in the quest to tackle corruption. Others claimed that it was biased. Ramaphosa says State Capture undermined and threatened government’s programme of social and economic transformation. “It also destroyed the capability of the state and led to the departure of capable people from public institutions as they resisted State Capture. Some were fired, some were forced to resign, and some just gave up, some were suspended for long periods and they left. Those were the critical skills that our country was robbed of people who knew the work, who knew what to do.” January 8th statement proceedings:
