The  African National Congress’ Mangaung Interim Regional Committee (IRC) has called for the suspension of Mangaung Metro Speaker, Stefani Lockman-Naidoo. This comes after Lockman-Naidoo allowed a council sitting to go ahead which resulted in the removal of acting City Manager, Sello More. More’s removal was supported by opposition and some disgruntled ANC councillors. The High Court in Bloemfontein found that Free State Cooperative Governance MEC, Mxolisi Dukwana, acted unlawfully by appointing More as acting City manager. IRC Coordinator, Sabelo Pitso, insists that action should be taken against Lockman-Naidoo. “The speaker continued with the council against the decisions of the organisation. Now that is what actually brought the results of today’s decision.  Now the IRC at as it was deliberating, we came into conclusion on the following matters that the Speaker be suspended with immediate effect,” says Pitso. Earlier this year, the ANC caucus in Mangaung said it stood by its decision to appoint More, as outlined in the video below:
