A 54-year-old suspect is expected to appear in the Knysna Magistrate’s Court in the Southern Cape on Saturday in connection with the theft of Kruger Rands worth about R8-million. The suspect, who police say had been on the run since 2012, was arrested in Wilderness. “The alleged offense was perpetrated between May 2011 and the 9th of March 2012. It is when the complainant owner of the Kruger Rands presented the commodity to the suspect for safekeeping as he was working at the bank at the time in Knysna. On request to return the Kruger Rands the suspect refused, compelling the complainant to lay a charge at the Knysna Police Station,” says Police spokesperson Malcolm Pojie.
