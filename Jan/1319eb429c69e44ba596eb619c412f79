The South African Nation Defence Force (SANDF) says investigations will continue on Monday morning to determine what could have caused the fire at the Waterkloof Air Force Base in Pretoria. Officials say a pipe burst at the bulk fuel area within the base on Sunday evening. Although foul play has not been ruled out, senior officials say the base is well secured. SANDF Spokesperson Brigadier-General Andries Mahapa says, “It was just an above ground pipe that had caught fire. So at the moment we cannot be in the position to say what was the cause.” He adds: “The chief fireman is busy with the investigation so that they can be in the position to give a detailed report on the cause. We are satisfied in terms of the speedy reaction of the fire brigade of the airforce, we are more than happy.” Fire at the Waterkloof Air Force Base in Tshwane under control: Brigadier-General Andries Mahapa
