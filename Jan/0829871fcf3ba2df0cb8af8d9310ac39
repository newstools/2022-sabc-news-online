Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has welcomed Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela’s handover of the Vrede Dairy Farm project to members of the community. Mkhwebane says the development concludes the implementation of the Public Protector’s remedial action as spelled out in a December 2020 investigation report. The report directs the provincial MEC for Agriculture and Rural Development to see to it that an audit of all those who were meant to benefit from the project is conducted. Ntombela on Thursday officially handed back a 51% stake in the R280 million farm to 65 beneficiaries. Mkhwebane congratulated the beneficiaries, saying the project would go a long way in helping tackle joblessness, poverty, and hunger in the province. The project was established 12-years-ago but most of the R220 million that was allocated to the project by the provincial government was diverted to the Gupta-linked company, Estina.
