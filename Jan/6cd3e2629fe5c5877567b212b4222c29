Schools in inland provinces of Gauteng, Free State, Mpumalanga, Limpopo and North West are scheduled to reopen on Wednesday. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga says the majority of learners have already been placed. Learners in the coastal provinces of KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Northern Cape, will reopen next week. Motshekga says there are a few provinces that are experiencing difficulties in finalising the placement of some learners, but she insists that these issues will be speedily resolved. “We have to say upfront, we have been able to place the majority of our learners but provinces like Gauteng, Western Cape and some areas in KwaZulu-Natal in the urban areas, we are still dealing with some problems.” “But provinces have assured us that they are doing everything in their power [to address challenges]. We are compelled to find places for every child. So it is not their burden alone but we are committing that we will find places for all the learners,” adds the minister. The video below is the full interview with Minister Motshekga:  Meanwhile, parents whose children remain unplaced around Tshwane schools have threatened to stop the lessons. In Ga-Rankuwa, parents still came in their large numbers as they strive to secure spaces for their Grade 1 and 8 children. Parents’ confusion is deepening as they express their frustration over the general inconvenience of the online system and failure to receive placement offers via SMS. Others have called for the MEC of Education Panyaza Lesufi to intervene.
