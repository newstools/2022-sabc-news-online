The Conty Lebepe Foundation is calling on Limpopo Premier Stan Mathabatha to expedite action on the Special Investigation Unit’s report against officials involved in PPE tender irregularities in the Health Department. The foundation wrote a letter to the office of President Cyril Ramaphosa alerting him of allegations of corrupt activities over the awarding of PPE tenders in the province in 2020. In its report, the SIU found that 33 tenders worth over R125 million were awarded irregularly in the department and other entities in the province. Deputy Chairperson of the foundation Ngako Setjie has also slammed the decision by the Office of the Premier not to speak to the media about the implementation of the report. “As Conlef we are very much worried because there are some recommendations from the SIU and our worry comes because the Office of the Premier says they don’t want to talk to the media because now we are worried why doesn’t he want to speak to the media because that thing is public and he must just implement the recommendations so that the law enforcement can take its course. We are sick and tired of the province of Limpopo just because people are looting every day,” says Setjie. VIDEO: SIU investigates sixty contracts to the value of R486 million in Limpopo
