Dlamini-Zulu is asking the court to assert her right to 50% of the late AmaZulu King’s estate based on her civil marriage to him. Proceedings of the hearing :  The Queen also wants the court to rule on the validity of the king’s five customary marriages. Zulu regiments, Amabutho ignored the directive by the AmaZulu Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi to desist from going to the Pietermaritzburg High Court. The civil matter was brought before the court by the first wife of the late AmaZulu King. The Queen married the King in community of property in 1969 under civil law. Her lawyers argued that their civil marriage precluded the king from entering into other polygamous marriages. King Zwelithini married five other wives under customary law following his civil marriage to the Queen. – Additional reporting by Simphiwe Makhanya
