The families of the three mineworkers, whose bodies were trapped underground at Lily Mine more than five years ago, say they are marking one thousand days camping outside the mine’s premises at Louville, near Barberton, in Mpumalanga. The families want the remains of their loved ones retrieved from underground. Yvonne Mnisi, Pretty Nkambule and Solomon Nyarenda were working inside a container which was buried when the mine collapsed in February 2016. The families’ Spokesperson Henry Mazibuko says a night vigil has been planned for Monday night. “The feeling here, especially the families part of us, we celebrating, we marking thousand days. Remember on our arrival we said we’re going nowhere until there is a solution, a way forward. The process started with retrieving the container, so that’s why we have been here. We’re not just saying it but we mean it and we are determined to stay another 1000 years as long there is no solution,” says Henry Mazibuko. VIDEO: Five years on, still no hope for Lily mine workers
