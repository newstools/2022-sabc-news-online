The parents of a 15-year-old Kimberley girl who has been selected to tour the facilities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) later this year have appealed for donations in helping their daughter realise her dream. Kimberley Girls High Grade 10 learner, Erin Salo dreams of being an astrophysicist. Erin says a NASA tour will bring her closer to achieving her dreams. Her mother, Stacey Salo says the funds raised will change her daughter’s life. “The first funding will be for the trip on its own, it will be like 61 thousand-rand. then there is another three days where they can go to Orlando and NASA, that amount will be determined by the exchange rate in September. The other part will be getting a visa and passport for her, and we can only fly out from Cape Town, Johannesburg or Durban.”
