There’s been a major decrease in the number of deaths among initiates in the Eastern Cape this year. Nine initiates have died in the province since the start of the winter initiation season. This is a decrease compared to the previous season when nearly 50 initiates died, mostly due to dehydration. All the deaths this season occurred in the OR Tambo District. Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Traditional Affairs recently conducted an oversight visit at initiation schools in the province. This period is usually a concern for parents as some initiates lose their lives at initiation schools. Nokuthembela Makupula is a parent from East London, who has just welcomed her son back from initiation. “Because we know some initiates did not come back during this June initiation period, it’s such a happy occasion for me today I’m elated beyond happy I thank God truly for this day I’m happy that my child is back its a joyous moment,” says Makupula.
