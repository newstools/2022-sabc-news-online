Prince Harry has called on world leaders to urgently take bold steps to tackle climate change. The Duke of Sussex was delivering his keynote address at the United Nations General Assembly to mark Nelson Mandela International Day. Every year on Madiba’s birthday, South Africans and the world pay tribute to the former President, by using 67 minutes of their time to support a chosen charity or serve in their local community. The 67 minutes symbolically represent the number of years in which Madiba fought for human rights and the abolition of apartheid. Prince Harry has urged the leaders to draw on Mandela’s resilience as they deal with difficult issues.
