Meanwhile, the MEC for Community Safety Security and Liaison Vusi Shongwe has condemned what the farmer did. “It is very wrong. Especially to young kids of 10 years and 13 years. Those are minors and they were supposed to be under the guardians of that farmer who is 41 years old.” He also called on angry residents not to take the law into their own hands. “We want to make a very serious appeal to the people of Mpumalanga and everyone else on behalf of the provincial government, that we  make sure that we become matured, sober and handle the matter in a responsible way.”
