Eskom CEO André de Ruyter says South Africa is expected to emerge from rolling blackouts by the end of the coming week. De Ruyter says the system is however still unreliable. “Towards the end of the coming week, we should emerge from rolling blackouts. We’ve already lifted our indication for rolling blackouts going forward. We’ve got a couple of big units returning towards the end of July, the risk will be significantly diminished once Koeberg 2 comes back to the grid. That will bring a large measure of relief, but ultimately to put rolling blackouts to bed. What we need is additional capacity, because the system as it is at the moment, is still unreliable and unpredictable,” says De Ruyter.
