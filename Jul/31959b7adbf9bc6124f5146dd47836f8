Yasmin Jessie Duarte Funeral Service:  Some ANC members in Polokwane, Limpopo, have commended the late Duarte for the role she played in the party during the absence of the suspended Secretary General, Ace Magashule. “It is a big loss, and its not well for us in a situation that we are approaching a national conference. We thought maybe she will recover and be part of the coming national conference. The DSG has been playing a vital role in the ANC at a particular time in the absence of the SG to make sure that the day-to-day organisation process is running.” Jessie Duarte: Limpopo pays tribute
