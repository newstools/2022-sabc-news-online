US President Joe Biden’s public approval rating fell to 36% this week to tie the lowest rating of his 19 months in the White House as inflation takes its toll on American life, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday. The two-day national poll found that 59% of Americans disapprove of Biden’s job performance. Biden’s approval rating has been below 50% since August 2021 and has hovered around its record-low since first hitting it in May, raising alarms his Democratic Party is on track to lose control of at least one chamber of Congress in the November 8 mid-term election. Biden’s rating fell three percentage points from 39% a week earlier. Biden’s popularity has suffered from a surge in inflation, which rose to a 40-year high in June at 9.1%. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped drive fuel prices higher. The COVID-19 pandemic has hindered global supply chains. Biden’s approval rating within his own party fell to 69% this week from 74% a week earlier. Only 11% of Republicans approve of his performance in office. Biden’s lowest ratings have rivaled the lows of his predecessor, Donald Trump, whose popularity bottomed out at 33%in December 2017. The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the United States. The latest poll gathered responses from a total of 1 003 adults, including 437 Democrats and 377 Republicans. It has a credibility interval – a measure of precision – of four percentage points.
