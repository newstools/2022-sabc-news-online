The outgoing SACP General Secretary Dr Blade Nzimande says he is ready to hand over what he says is a much stronger SACP to the younger generation. Nzimande will step down this week as SACP leader after being at the helm of the party for over 24 years. He took over from Charles Ngqakula in 1998 and he is the second longest serving leader of the SACP after Moses Kotane. In an exclusive interview with SABC News ahead of the SACP 15th national congress which starts in Boksburg on Tuesday, Nzimande said under his leadership and that of the entire collective, the SACP has become a home of over 300 000 members from just 10 000 in 1998. “Absolutely I am handing over a much larger Communist Party than it has ever been in its 101 years now there is no doubt about that. It’s a much stronger Communist Party in the sense it has got a presence throughout our nine provinces, in many communities, in urban areas, townships, informal settlements and in the rural areas. Nzimande says despite the party being stronger in numbers, it still faces challenges. “It does not mean that it does not have challenges but certainly I am proud that it is actually a much stronger party also it has been a party for most of this time I have been a General Secretary that has been united. ”
