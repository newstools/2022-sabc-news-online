He says they have issues with Google Maps that have added to the challenges. “We have a challenge with Google Maps. It has kicked us out because we are at 6 000 per minute in terms of your searches in the system. So we have surpassed the 6 000 in terms of our agreement with them. So that’s why they decided to kick us out, but we are interacting with them so they can increase to 20 000. We should not be having any problems. We have never experienced this. This is for the first time,” says Mabona.  MEC Panyaza Lesufi has promised that every eligible learner will be placed in the province. He was addressing them media on Thursday ahead of the launch of the online system. Lesufi says money has been allocated for the construction of additional classrooms to cater for the increasing demand for popular public schools.
