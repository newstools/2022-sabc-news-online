In a statement, National Treasury said it would continue to demonstrate its commitment to fiscal sustainability and enable long-term growth by narrowing the budget deficit and sizable debt.

According to Fitch, South Africa’s ratings are supported by a favourable debt structure with long maturities as well as a credible monetary policy framework.
