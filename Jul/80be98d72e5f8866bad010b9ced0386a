So the taxi was just on the side of the road with the people standing on the side of the road as well. This car just came in and hit everything and smashed everything that was on its path, and one of the members who were in the hospital we heard that he has lost his life as well and the number now is sitting at 12.” The KwaZulu-Natal Acting MEC for Transport together with Umgungundlovu District Municipality Mayor, Councillor Mzi Zuma and Head of Department Mr Siboniso Mbhele met with the families of the 12 people who died in a fatal road accident at the Mpophomeni Community Hall.
