The White House on said Monday it anticipates major oil producers in the OPEC+ alliance to increase crude production following President Joe Biden’strip to the Middle East. “We will measure success in the next couple of weeks,” said White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre at a press briefing. “We anticipate to be an increase in production, but it’s going to take the next couple of weeks, and that will be up to OPEC+.” Biden travelled to Saudi Arabia last week where he met with that country’s leadership and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council in the oil-rich Middle East. The Biden administration has come under pressure to cut gas prices and other consumer costs ahead of the November 8 mid-term elections where his Democratic Party is seeking to retain control of Congress. Oil prices rocketed to their highest levels since 2008, climbing above $139 a barrel in March, after the United States and Europe imposed sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a “special military operation.” Prices have slipped since then. OPEC+, which includes both Saudi Arabia and Russia, meets next on August 3.
