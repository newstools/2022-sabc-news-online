The City of Tshwane says it has disconnected about 800 illegal electricity connections at the Brazzaville Informal Settlement outside Pretoria. City of Tshwane spokesperson, Sipho Stuurman, says the illegal connections were made to the Phelindaba overhead line which supplies areas such as Schurveberg and other nearby areas. He says they had a negative effect on the supply of electricity to residential and commercial consumers. “During the operation at Brazzaville informal settlement, an estimated R400 000 of electrical material was removed, including 11 kV overhead lines, aluminium conductors, and aluminium aerial bundle conductors. Our teams also removed three medium-voltage transformers. This is a significant set of stolen infrastructure. Illegal connections are the reason many areas experience power trips after loadshedding which result in extended power outages.”
