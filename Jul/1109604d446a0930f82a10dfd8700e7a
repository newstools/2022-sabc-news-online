He also met with President Muhammadu Buhari earlier on Tuesday. OPEC in a statement said, “He was the much-loved leader of the OPEC Secretariat and his passing is a profound loss to the entire OPEC Family, the oil industry and the international community,” Nigeria’s government also said his passing was a great loss to the country. The Nigerian oil industry veteran was due to step down at the end of this month after six years at the OPEC top job.
