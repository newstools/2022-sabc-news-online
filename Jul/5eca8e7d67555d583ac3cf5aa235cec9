Follow-up investigations led the team to one of the farms where the carcass of a dehorned rhino and the other injured one we found, the other suspects managed to evade arrest that as the suspect will appear in Ritavi state court on Monday.” Video| Kruger National Park bolsters anti-rhino poaching measures
