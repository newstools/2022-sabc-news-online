Congress of the People (COPE)’s Youth Movement has given President Cyril Ramaphosa seven working days to come up with tangible solutions to the economic challenges in the country.

At the Union Buildings, the youth handed out a list of grievances. These are rising fuel prices, unemployment, and Eskom’s continuous blackouts.

Others rely on their grandparents’ pension but the current economic climate has made life more challenging. COPE’s Youth Movement says there’s a little political will to resolve issues affecting the youth and that this is a ticking time bomb.
