The newly elected Gauteng Provincial Executive Committee members include former Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko and former Health MEC in Gauteng Bandile Masuku. They were both implicated in the multi-million rand Personal Protective Equipment tender scandal in 2020. Both of them lost their government positions but were reinstated to the Provincial Executive Committee after disciplinary processes.
