The Minister of International Relations Dr. Naledi Pandor says mediation efforts in the Kingdoms of Lesotho and Eswatini are progressive and constructive. However, Lesotho’s Parliament has been accused of dragging its feet over crucial reforms that must be voted into law ahead of the October general elections.

The Kingdom experienced a spate of protests calling Mswati III to relinquish power and democratise the country.
