For every criminal activity committed in Gauteng, the police have been doing the best they can to hunt them down. And I must say that we have been strengthening the police teams that have been dealing with all sorts of crime. We must continue to do so.” Video| No goods stolen from Nomzamo tavern making it a possible hit
