Earlier, Eastern Cape Police Spokesperson, Brigadier Thembinkosi Kinana urged people not to speculate the results of the investigation, including the post-mortem results as the process is yet to be completed. Kinana said, “You need to [be] very meticulous when you deal with a case like this one, which is not an obvious case. So, that is why we are saying, let us be so kind to give our detectives the time to do their work. So [that] we can get results that we all are proud of and get answers of what has happened,” added Kinana.
