The Congress of South Africa Trade Unions (Cosatu) president Zingiswa Losi has warned that slogans will not change the living conditions of the poor and the working class.

Losi says the SACP must refrain from turning socialism into a mirage that keeps on being postponed. She says leaders have been speaking about socialism until they leave office. #SACPCongress2022 Losi says the party has been silent of the struggles faced by workers. #sabcnews pic.twitter.com/GyiMGmpj8z — #LordOfTheMedia (@samkelemaseko) July 14, 2022  COSATU president Zingiswa Losi addresses delegates:  Earlier, Losi implored delegates to help to cleanse the African National Congress (ANC) of what she called “demons of factionalism and corruption”.
