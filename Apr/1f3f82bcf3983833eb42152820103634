Clashes broke out between two groups during a religious procession in New Delhi injuring security personnel and others, said a senior police official on Saturday. Members belonging to two communities engaged in violent attacks in the national capital’s Jahangirpuri area during a procession dedicated to the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman, police said. “Some police officials were also injured in this. As of now, we are still in the field and our main aim is to maintain law and order,” said Special Commissioner, Delhi Police, Dependra Pathak. People at the attack site were heard shouting Hindu religious slogans as the police cordoned off the area.
Delhi Chief, Arvind Kejriwal condemned the clashes in a tweet and asked people to maintain peace.
