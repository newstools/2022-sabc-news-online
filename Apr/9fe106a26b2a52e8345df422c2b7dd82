One South Africa Movement leader, Mmusi Maimane says the City of Johannesburg should use its budget to stimulate small businesses and create jobs for the youth. He was speaking to the media in Braamfontein where he delivered a memorandum of demands to the Johannesburg City council. Almost 12 million people in South Africa are unemployed or have given up looking for a job. Maimane says similar memoranda will be delivered to other metro councils across the country as they prepare to present their annual budgets. “We are going to deliver them in all eight metros. We want to make sure in all metros we hold them accountable to deliver services. We can’t be going and marching fighting this one or this person. It is the duty of government to create conditions upon which businesses can work and metros must be at the forefront of that issue.”
