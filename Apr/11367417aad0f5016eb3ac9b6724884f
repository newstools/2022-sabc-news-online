Additional water tankers will be dispatched to the most impacted wards in eThekwini. This follows a week of heavy rains and floods across KwaZulu-Natal that caused extensive damage to water infrastructure. Earlier in the week, tankers battled to access communities with several access roads cut off. Water supply has been restored in several areas in the municipality. Latest from SABC News reporter Vusi Khumalo who is in Kwadukuza:  In a statement, the eThekwini Municipality says damage to Umgeni Water infrastructure has resulted in Umgeni supplying less than 50% of its normal water volumes. Umgeni is the bulk water supplier to eThekwini. The municipality says Umgeni Water has committed to at least 96% of the normal supply to the metro being restored by April 24th.
