The Senzo Meyiwa murder case has been postponed yet again in the High Court in Pretoria. This is after the lawyer for one of the five accused Sifisokuhle Ntuli asked for the matter to stand down until the 22nd of this month to allow them to further prepare for it. The matter was postponed on Tuesday to allow advocate Zandile Mshololo to further consult. Mshololo argued that granting the postponement was in the interest of justice. Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela granted the postponement with a warning. “The court rules that it grants the request for further postponement. The court also on a way put the reps of accused number five to terms to say that this should be the last time that this case sees a postponement and therefore this case is postponed,” says Maumela.
