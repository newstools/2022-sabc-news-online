Former Botswana President Ian Khama has denied he’s a fugitive and says he’s not running away from justice in his home country. Khama is currently in South Africa after he fled the neighbouring country. He’s charged with the unlawful possession of firearms in Botswana. He has since described the charges as trumped up and part of the persecution he has suffered at the hands of Botswana.
