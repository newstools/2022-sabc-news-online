The Weather Service says parts of South Africa may soon experience snowfall with cold and wet weather conditions persisting across the country. Snow may fall over parts of the Drakensberg and Lesotho. Meteorologist Kumsa Masizana says,  “It looks like it is only going to come in on Sunday, so it is only going to affect the high lying areas of Lesotho and southern Drakensberg, so those areas of Kokstad, going into Overberg, they are going to get their first snowfall for the season.” “We are expecting below normal temperatures for the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, which is also indicative of possible snowfall. The Northern Cape is usually quite dry but with this type of system, we are seeing a lot of rainfall coming in. The Western Cape is looking quite good but the temperatures have already started dropping. Temps are going to be cold for Saturday/Sunday and on Monday it is going to spread to Limpopo, Mpumalanga etc, so there is going to be that drop in temperatures.” SA Weather | Saturday 09 April 2022: On Friday, the Weather Service said they are expecting heavy rainfall this weekend over some parts of Gauteng and the North West. It may lead to flooding. Gauteng temperatures are expected to peak at 12-degrees on Saturday and 11-degrees on Sunday. The North West province can expect temperatures of 14 and 16 degrees over the weekend. Senior forecaster, Jacquline Modipa said: “As of this evening (Friday), we do have potential disruptive rain that might lead to localised flooding of some areas, especially low-lying areas from this evening into the early hours of tomorrow (Saturday) that will mainly be the southern parts of Gauteng that will be affected.
