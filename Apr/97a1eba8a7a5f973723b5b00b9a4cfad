The Department of Health in the North West says health services have been restored in Deelpan following continuous flooding in the area. Since the floods wreaked havoc in January, ambulances and public transport have been unable to gain access to the area. This poses a challenge for residents, many of whom have to collect medication from clinics on a monthly basis. “This team has been working on the ground to ensure that even people who were on ARVS, TB, and hypertension were traced and put back on treatment. The treatment for children including immunization, deworming, vitamin A and all those are now being given to the recipients,” department spokesperson Tebogo Lekgethwane elaborates. Lekgethwane has also cautioned residents about contaminated water in the area that is unsafe for human consumption. “The department has also been able to test the water and found that two of the water sources have been contaminated. Only one water source is drinkable. So the department is encouraging and urging the community to boil the water before any use,” Lekgethwane added.
