The South African Council of Churches (SACC) is calling on all members of the Christian faith to use Good Friday to also pray for the victims of of those who lost their lives and others who were affected by the devastating floods in KwaZulu-Natal. The SACC has extended condolences to the people of KwaZulu-Natal where at least 341 people lost their lives.  SACC Secretary-General Bishop Malusi Mpumlwana says the SACC spearheaded by the KwaZulu-Natal Christian Council in the province is actively responding to the devastating damage and loss to property and life. Mpumlwana says donations to assist victims and affected communities are accepted and people are urged to contact the KZNCC in the province. “The devastation we have seen – the destruction of homes, schools and churches and the loss of lives – brings us to our knees as we pray for the safety of the people of that province. As the country celebrates Easter this weekend, the SACC encourages members of the Christian faith to set aside a moment of prayer on Good Friday (15 April) to pray for KZN and the victims of the floods.” Mpumlwana added: “Whether in our homes, or in our religious spaces – let us offer prayers for the province, and those affected by the floods. Let us pray for safety, pray for the comfort of those who have lost families, their homes and livelihoods. Let us pray in faith, that with the Resurrection of Christ on the third day, the spirit of restoration will wash over the province.”
