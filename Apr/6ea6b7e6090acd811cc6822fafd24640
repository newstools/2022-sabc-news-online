Chief Economist at Efficient Group, Dawie Root, says an interest hike is definitely on the cards. “Inflation is likely to move up to above 6% in the next couple of months and that is the global phenomenon with inflationary pressures building up.  In these kinds of circumstances, there’s very little that central banks can do but increase interest rates and the South African central bank already indicated that they’ll keep in tapering monetary policy. So I think it’s pretty much a given now that the Reserve bank will again increase interest rates next month.”
