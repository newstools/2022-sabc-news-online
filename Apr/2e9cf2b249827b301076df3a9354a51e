Former eThekwini mayor Zandile Gumede says she’s optimistic that she will soon be cleared of the corruption charges against her and take up her new position. She has been re-elected chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC’s) eThekwini region in KwaZulu-Natal, defeating her opponent Thabani Nyawose. She received 210 votes against her opponent, Nyawose’s 181 votes. Gumede has been elected despite having had to step aside because of the corruption case against her. Gumede was at home during the conference because of the step-aside rule. “I’m the Member of Parliament; I’m working for the community. My leadership said because I’ve been charged although I’m still waiting for the real charges. They said let me just pause for a second so that the society can see that the law is taking its course and as a leader, I must be seen to be complying. Other than that I’m quite confident that it’s not going to be long, I’m going to be off the hook and me and my team are going to be working very hard,” says Gumede. Meanwhile, Nyawose has conceded defeat and says he will fully support the newly-elected ANC provincial leadership. “For me, I don’t see anything wrong for her availing herself to contest because she has a right as a member of the ANC. She has already respected the step aside rule because the step aside rule does not prevent her to avail herself if she is nominated. The majority of ANC members or branches in eThekwini believe in her leadership. All of us have to accept that she is our leader and she is going to lead us in the next three years,” says Nyawose.
