The Umlazi Taxi Association says this week’s recent floods in KwaZulu-Natal have hampered their operations. Several roads in and around Umlazi in eThekwini remain blocked after torrential rains hit the area earlier this week.  More than 300 people have lost their lives so far. Disaster management teams continue to work around the clock to assist those in affected communities. Chairperson of the Umlazi Taxi Association, Artwell Thabethe says, “In Umlazi, two days taxis are not working from the time. We had this water problem and now even yesterday we tried to get a TLB to help us to remove everything, the water and the sand on the road and we did it but no one came to help us to move the containers on the road to go to Durban.” VIDEO | Nozintombi Miya is at the old airport precinct near Umlazi:  Government to assist On Wednesday, President Cyril Ramaphosa assured residents affected by the damage caused by heavy rains in KwaZulu-Natal, that the government will assist them.
