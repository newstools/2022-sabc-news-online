The Portfolio Committee on Human Settlements is set to hold public hearings on the Housing Consumer Protection Bill in three Eastern Cape regions this weekend. The aim of the public engagements is to garner views on the Bill. It aims to regulate and streamline processes to ensure consumers’ protection within the home building environment and that they are able to access warranty cover should they need it. Committee Chairperson Machwene Semenya hopes the public will provide quality input. “The committee invites all individuals and interested organisations to come and make inputs on the Bill to ensure that the final product is reflective of their will and aspiration. The committee is cognisant that this hearing is happening while the country continues to face the risk posed by COVID-19. COVID-19 regulation will be implemented to ensure the safety of all participants,” says Semenya. The first leg of these hearings will be held at Ikhwezi Hall in Mthatha on Friday, followed by the NU10 Hall in Mdantsane on Saturday, with the last leg at The Wells Estate Hall in Gqeberha on Sunday.
