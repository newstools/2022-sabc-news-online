Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Minister, Doctor Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has urged KwaZulu-Natal municipalities to speed up aid to communities affected by recent floods. Dlamini-Zuma conducted an oversight visit to the Provincial Disaster Management Center in Pietermaritzburg. She was taken through the warehouse where food, mattresses and other necessities are being kept before final allocation is done for various communities. Dlamini-Zuma says it is up to municipalities to place orders. “That stuff is waiting for them to pick it up and say we need so much there. It is not something to be done from the national level. From the national level we must make sure the stuff is there. From the local level they must make sure the stuff move,” says Dlamini-Zuma .
