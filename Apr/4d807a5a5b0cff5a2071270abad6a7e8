The Jacob Zuma Foundation says former president Jacob Zuma is still in hospital where doctors are treating him for an undisclosed illness. Zuma fell ill yesterday just hours before the start of his fraud and corruption trial in the High Court in Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal. His attorney, Advocate Dali Mpofu informed Judge Piet Koen that his client was unwell. But Advocate Mpofu requested that their application for a postponement should proceed pending reconsideration from president of the Supreme Court of Appeal. The Foundation’s spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi, “Yes indeed I can confirm that yesterday his Excellency [former] president Zuma could not attend court proceedings due to ill health. Doctors did take him to hospital to run all kinds of tests on him. We don’t know how long he will be in this situation. We call on South Africa to keep him in their prayers.” VIDEO: Former President Zuma not present in court due to ill health: Nthabiseng Dubazana
