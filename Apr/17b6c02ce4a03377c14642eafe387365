Eskom says it has implemented stage 2 rolling blackouts on Monday night. The power utility says unit 5 of Medupi Power Station tripped. The power utility earlier urged the public to reduce electricity usage as the power generation system was severely constrained. It said four generation units suffered breakdowns, while the return to service of two other units has been delayed. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says the inclement weather has also increased the demand for electricity. “Regrettably Unit 5 of Medupi Power Station has just tripped just after 6pm. This, unfortunately has taken down some 700MW capacity with. [As a result] this has necessitated the immediate implementation of rolling blackouts,” explains Mantshantsha. #UrgentNotice #Loadshedding #Stage2 Unit 5 of Medupi Power Station has just tripped, taking some 700MW capacity with.
