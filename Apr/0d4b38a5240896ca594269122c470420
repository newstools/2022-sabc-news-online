Department spokesperson Mhlaba Memela says, “We are very much disturbed by the murder of the four-year-old toddler allegedly by her mother in Ballito to learn what the woman had said to the police claiming that the child was troublesome…” Memela says, “It is very shocking because there is no reason for her to throw the child in a bucket full of water and also tie her both hands, it is clear that she had planned what she did which then resulted in the child dying. We are happy the police responded swiftly and ensured the woman was arrested. We are calling on the court to ensure the woman does not get bail.” The matter has been adjourned to May 5, 2022 for further investigation.
