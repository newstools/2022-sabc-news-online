A member of the AmaZulu royal family, Prince Afrika Zulu, says the late Princess Thembi Zulu-Ndlovu should not only be remembered as a leader of the faction that wants Prince Simakade Zulu to be the next AmaZulu King. Prince Afrika says she was someone who respected the throne. Princess Thembi Zulu-Ndlovu who was the sister of the late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini passed away on Friday following a prolonged kidney condition. Princess Thembi was one of the key members of the AmaZulu royal house who was challenging AmaZulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini’s ascendancy to the throne. Prince Afrika says Princess Thembi stood resolute until her death. “We cannot hide the fact that Princess Thembi died while she was leading the faction which fought for the recognition of Prince Simakade as King. She fought this to her last breath and she stood resolute. However, she maintained her respect for the monarch and she should be remembered as someone who had a deep respect for the monarch, not just as someone who opposed King-elect Misuzulu,” says Prince Afrika.
