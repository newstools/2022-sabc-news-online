Before the match, Sundowns co-coach Manqoba Mgqithi said he’s happy to see fans back at the stadium “We’ve got our supporters back into our matches and the only thing that one would want to see is to urge our supporters to come in numbers to support us and not treat this game as a dead rubber. We don’t treat it as a dead rubber, Al-Merrick is one of the best teams in Sudan, it’s a team that has won three championships in a row. We would love to play this match with our supporters and enjoy that drumbeat again, enjoy that singing and see how the team responds.”
