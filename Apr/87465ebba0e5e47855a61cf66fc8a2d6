April marks World Autism Awareness Month. Scores of parents and caregivers with children with Autism embarked on a march to the East London city hall in the Eastern Cape on Friday to hand over a memorandum of demands. The march was led by Autism Matters, an East London based non-profit organisation. Parents say they have been side-lined for years by the provincial government and want the state to prioritise the building of schools that cater for special needs children. World Autism Month seeks to continuously engage society in understanding and accepting Autism. The NPO is also calling for more employment opportunities and adult support programmes for Autistic people. The Department of Education in the province accepted the memorandum of demands.
