May God be with everyone affected by the #KZNFloods pic.twitter.com/VLyHo1hGFI — Senarh (@sena_sishi) April 12, 2022  Some have called for Eskom not to continue with blackouts as emergency services and victims need electricity. @Eskom_SA, the last thing that the people of @eThekwiniM & KZN need right now is #loadshedding. Homes are flooded and there are rescue missions being attempted, yet you switch the off the power. Give people a chance to evacuate safely. #Durban #DurbanFloods #KZNFloods #eskomkzn — Sibongiseni Maphumulo (@SiboMaphumulo) April 11, 2022  Authorities can’t control natural disasters but had they not been corrupt, times like this wouldn’t result in so much damage… fix drainage systems everywhere, make proper stable bridges, fix the roads. praying for everyone in KZN may God protect you  #KZNFloods — Zealot Titusson (@titusson_zealot) April 11, 2022  The weather God disapproves zandile gumede #KZNFloods pic.twitter.com/9cdUWTvVPE — The Great One (@Kash786787) April 11, 2022
