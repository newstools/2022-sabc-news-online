The Carling Currie Cup Premier Division match between the Sharks and the Bulls, scheduled for Durban on Saturday afternoon, has been cancelled. Due to the considerable loss of life, infrastructure damage across the province and out of respect to the community in the face of the disaster, the two teams have agreed to cancel this encounter. There was no alternative option to reschedule the match. As a result, it will be declared a draw and the points will be shared, with each team awarded two log points. Both teams are in the top four on the log and on course for the play-offs. Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa has assured residents affected by the damage caused by heavy rains in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), that the government will assist them. Over 50 people have died while many others have been left destitute as their homes have been destroyed by the flooding. KZN Premier, Sihle Zikalala earlier declared the province a disaster area. Ramaphosa is visiting various communities in the province in the midst of the floods. “What is painful is that a lot of people have died. Their homes have been destroyed, streets, towns and this church has been destroyed. So, we said let’s go to the areas to see the damage ourselves in order to see how the government can help,” Ramaphosa.
