Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says it is important to invest in special needs education to ensure access and improved quality programmes for learners with special needs. Lesufi was speaking at the commemoration of World Autism Awareness Day at Randburg Clinic School, north of Johannesburg. Autism is a lifelong developmental disability that manifests itself during the first three years of life and is believed to affect between one and two percent of people according to the organisation Autism South Africa. Lesufi says individuals with autism need to be accepted as an integral part of society. “Our approach is simple, our children must learn, we are not opening these schools to babysit our children. We are not opening these schools for our children to be guided just for them to survive, we went to impart knowledge to our children so that they can be part of the skills revolution of our country. These children will not be confined to switchboard operators, we will produce good people that will come out of this sector, and that’s our commitment, that’s our investment.” “Autistic children are not third class citizens, autistic children are not second class citizens. They remain first class citizens of our education system,” said @EducationGP1 MEC Panyaza @Lesufi today at Randburg Clinic School’s commemoration of #WorldAutismDay. pic.twitter.com/xkmLOy7N7U — Gauteng Department of Education (@EducationGP1) April 2, 2022  Randburg Clinic School created its own Sensory Tunnel that comprises of various sensory stimuli which calms and relaxes learners. @EducationGP1 MEC Panyaza @Lesufi was given a walkthrough the tunnel today during World Autism Awareness Day. | @Steve_Mabona #WAAD2022 pic.twitter.com/HpCPJ3TH7c — Gauteng Department of Education (@EducationGP1) April 2, 2022
