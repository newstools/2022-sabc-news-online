Power utility, Eskom says Stage 2 loadshedding will end at 5am on Tuesday morning. The power utility implemented loadshedding just after 6pm on Monday evening after Unit 5 of Medupi Power Station tripped. Eskom spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha says the inclement weather has also increased the demand for electricity. “Eskom would like to inform the public that this constrained supply situation will persist throughout the week, with the possibility that more loadshedding is likely to be implemented should the generation capacity deteriorate further. Today one generating unit at Kriel Power Station, as well as two generating units at Camden Power Station experienced breakdowns. Furthermore, a generating unit at Tutuka power station is delayed returning to service, contributing to the current shortage of capacity.” Mantshantsha added: “The two generation units that had broken down at Matla Power Station have returned to service this evening. These, however, will take some time to reach full generation output. We currently have 4 804MW on planned maintenance, while another 14 759MW of capacity is unavailable due to unplanned breakdowns. We are managing the emergency generation reserves to limit the stage of loadshedding. This overnight loadshedding will be used to replenish the dam level at the pump storage power stations in preparation for tomorrow.” #POWERALERT2 Stage 2 loadshedding was implemented at 18:12 today and will be suspended at 05:00 on
