Civil movement Operation Dudula says South Africans are subjected to squatter camps while buildings are hijacked by foreign nationals. The organisation says it has asked Public Protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, to investigate government’s role in the number of buildings that have been hijacked in the country’s city centres – allegedly by foreign nationals. Operation Dudula’s Deputy National Chairperson, Dan Radebe says they have sought the Public Protector’s assistance because the government is doing nothing to deal with illegal immigrants. Radebe addressed the media in Durban about their activities in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). “Who said our people deserve to stay in the slums and in the squatter camps? And then we have got non-South Africans who just come into the country and hijack the buildings and just occupy it. Because South Africans are law-abiding citizens, they are stuck in the squatter camps because they respect the law,” says Radebe. “So, we are saying the Public Protector must hold the government accountable. She must hold the Department of Employment and Labour accountable. How come in the South African industry we have got illegal [immigrants] employed by those companies? It means the Department of Employment and Labour is not doing its job. Public Protector must come in and intervene on behalf of South Africans,” adds Radebe.
