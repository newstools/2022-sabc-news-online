The search for three people, including a three-month-old baby, continues under heaps of mud and rubble in eMachobeni, in Inanda north of Durban, following the flooding in KwaZulu-Natal. At least 443 people have died from the floods in the province. Persistent rains are hampering rescue operations. Residents are optimistic that the arrival of search and rescue teams will help them find their loved ones who are still missing. They include a three-month-old child whose 14-year-old sibling died after being swept away in mudslides. Her body was found by the community. Community leader Ziphathe Shabane says, “We have lost 10 people in our area. We are still searching for three people. We have recovered the bodies of seven people. We are working closely with the police in trying to find the three people that are still missing. We were able to save the mother of the three-month-old child. We recovered the body of her 14-year-old child.” KZN FLOODS | Search and rescue continues for missing persons – Bongani Gema updates:
