The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng has again called for embassies to be billed for patients from their countries who are treated in hospitals within the province. The party made the call following a video that has gone viral online of pregnant women sleeping on the floor at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in Johannesburg. The DA’s shadow Health MEC in Gauteng, Jack Bloom says this proposal isn’t new. “Billing foreign embassies for their own patients is a proposal that the Gauteng provincial government has advocated in the past. In fact I recall some years ago that they said they were going to send the bills to various embassies. So, I’m going to ask in the Gauteng legislature yet again, are you doing this? It seems to me like it’s a good idea. It seems fair and why shouldn’t foreign countries pay the medical bills for their own citizens?” says Bloom
