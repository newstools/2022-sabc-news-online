The National Union of Metalworkers South Africa (Numsa) says it has received correspondence from airline operator Comair about the formal withdrawal of its Section 189 notice. The airline had served Numsa with the Section 189 beginning of March, as it sought to cut salaries by 15% and to reduce the medical aid benefit of its employees. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, has called the decision a victory for workers. “This is an issue that workers actually picketed over, in the month of March, when they were highlighting the safety issue, when the airline was grounded, and at the same time also raising the fact that while this airline is being grounded, the management of Comair, is also threatening workers with reducing their benefits and conditions. This decision was going to affect the entire workforce, all 1 300 workers were going to be affected.” Implications of the suspension of all Comair flights: Goitse Diale  SA Civil Authority gives Comair ultimatum The authority said is following investigations that suggest that there are safety risks at the operator. It goes on to say that in February, Comair operations experienced issues ranging from engine failure to engine and landing gear malfunctions. Comair risks indefinite suspension if it fails to meet the requirements. Civil Aviation Authority of South Africa said in the interest of safety it visited the operator to investigate and determine if the operator is in compliance with applicable civil aviation regulations. It said due to the failure of the operator to produce satisfactory evidence to the regulator led to the decision to impose a precautionary suspension of the operations in order to give the operator an opportunity to demonstrate that their systems are able to prevent and avert safety hazards.
