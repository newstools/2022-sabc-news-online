The insurgency in Mozambique is topping the agenda of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) organ troika’s virtual summit on Tuesday. President Cyril Ramaphosa is participating as Chair of SADC organ on politics, defence and security co-operation. According to President Ramaphosa, significant progress has been made in the fight against terrorism in Mozambique. Recently, SADC leaders expressed their satisfaction with the work of the regional bloc’s mission deployed in the country. The SADC heads of state virtual meeting has been preceded by a ministerial session where they look at the current situation in Mozambique. SADC deployed its mission to assist Mozambique in repelling terror attacks in Cabo Delgado province. The summit will further look at ways to support Cabo Delgado as it seeks to reconstruct. “We meet almost six months after we approved the standby force mission in Mozambique to combat acts of terrorism for 3 months. We then met in Pretoria to extend the mandate and called for the restoration of law and order in recaptured areas. The ministerial committee had directed SADC to develop SAMIM exit strategy.” SADC Troika Summit I President Cyril Ramaphosa’s opening remarks:
