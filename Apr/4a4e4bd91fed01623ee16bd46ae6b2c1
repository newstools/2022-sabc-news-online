Johannesburg Mayor, Dr Mpho Phalatse says concerns have been raised by the Diepsloot community around issues of alleviating population density – with some people saying the issuing of housing units has not solved the density problem. Diepsloot was recently plunged into violence, following a spate of murders, leading to an intervention by the Police and Home Affairs Ministers. Phalatse says the housing situation, as it is right now, is ripe for criminal activity. “What I’ve been told is that as much as we’re decanting and trying to de-densify, the shacks don’t get demolished and that some members of those families remain behind, and only certain members go to the new units that we handover. So, it’s not really solving the problem. That is something that we really need to look into because with the current density of the area, crime will be prevalent, and it will be very difficult to control it,” says Phalatse . Johannesburg mayor Dr Mpho Phalatse visits Diepsloot   ‘No use deploying police into an area where there are socio-economic problems’ Phalatse says some of the factors driving the violence in Diepsloot are socio-economic in nature. These include unemployment and inadequate housing. Phalatse has visited the police station to meet with management. Diepsloot has been making headlines following a spate of murders in the area. The Mayor has promised to address issues like housing. “There’s no use deploying police into an area where there are socio-economic problems that you are not addressing. We got issues of housing. They need to de-densify the area. I do not know if you are aware of Riverside. We moving people from Diepsloot to the area. But I’ve just discovered that some people are remaining. So when we move you we must demolish the shack in the area,” says Phalatse.
