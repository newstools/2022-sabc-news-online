Guesthouse owners and those residing along the Bloemhof Dam and Vaal River in North West have been hit by yet another flood disaster. Guesthouse owner Sias Meyer say his guesthouse in Bloemhof was forced to close shop yet again while trying to recover from the January floods that forced many to evacuate the area. Meyer says many in the community have lost valuables, jobs and incurred damages amounting to hundreds of thousands of rand with no relief funding from government. “Yes, it’s another flood serious (sic). We did not get anything from government although they promised R200 million in the previous flood. We have even written a letter to the Premier of the North West, Bushy and they have not pitched any money, nothing,” says Meyer. VIDEO: North West Flooding – Update from Vaal River and Bloemhof
