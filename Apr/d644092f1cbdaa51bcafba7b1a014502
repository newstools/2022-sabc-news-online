Motorists will again have to fork out more at the fuel pumps as the price of petrol is set to increase to a new record high from midnight. Even with government’s intervention to cushion the steep increase, fuel prices are still high. Last week, government announced it would intervene and reduced the general fuel levy by R1.50 a litre. Petrol is expected to increase by thirty cents and diesel by more than R1.50 a litre.  Motorists will again feel the brunt of higher fuel prices this week as petrol is set to increase to yet another record high level. The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy is expected to make announcements on the new fuel price either later this evening or early tomorrow morning. Last week, the department announced interventions that will see the price of fuel significantly less than what was expected in March. The country is experiencing record high fuel costs due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine which has caused global oil prices to sky rocket.
