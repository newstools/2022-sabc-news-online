He says opposition parties in the country have young leaders and the ANC must keep up with such competition. Some ANC structures have endorsed Lamola for the position of party deputy president ahead of the national conference which will take place in December. But he says that should happen through ANC internal processes. “We’ll respond to the challenges of the country in terms of generational mix, but also in terms of responding to the reality that we have two biggest opposition in the country, that are led by youthful generations. So the ANC must also respond to that in terms of its top six, but also in the National Executive as a whole. Whether we will be there contesting or not, we will leave that to the processes of the organization and respond at the right time.” ANC Mpumalanga elective conference underway: Samkelo Maseko
