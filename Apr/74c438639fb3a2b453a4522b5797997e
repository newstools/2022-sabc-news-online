Zandile Gumede predicted as likely victor in battle for ANC Ethekwini chairperson position Delays The nomination of candidates for leadership positions in eThekwini region finally got underway at the elective conference after being delayed by almost a day. Delegates finally agreed that the regional task team will not be voting. The nomination and the election of leadership was supposed to happen on Saturday night, but it was delayed due to disagreements among delegates. ANC national Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, has explained why the eThekwini regional task team was not allowed to vote during the elective conference. “In an event where the RTT established would have been constituted by members of the ANC in that specific region, that RTT would have full powers to vote. But the practice in KZN has been that people who are brought in to lead these RTT could be people who come or reside outside that region. So what it means is that they do not meet a minimum threshold to constitute a delegation in that specific region. So a minimum threshold of you to constitute a delegate in a region is that you must be a member in good standing in that specific region,”says Mabe.
