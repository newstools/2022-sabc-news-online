Police in Kenya’s Iten town are investigating the circumstances that led to the death of a 24-year-old Kenyan-Bahranian female athlete. Damaris Muthee Mutua’s decomposing body was found in one of the homes in the city famous for world-beating athletes. Police say the long distance runner, was last seen in the company of her Ethiopian boyfriend in the town. Sarah Kimani reports Muthee’s decomposing remains were found in the man’s house on Tuesday, with preliminary investigations indicating that she may have been killed by her boyfriend who has since fled the country. Police say the suspect called one of his friends in Iten informing him about the incident and he in turn alerted the police. Muthee’s killing comes seven months since former world record holder and two-time world championship bronze medalist, Agnes Tirop was found dead at her home in Iten. Tirop died of a stab wound to her neck and a blunt trauma to the head. Her husband is facing murder charges for her death.
