The Gauteng Tourism Authority (GTA) says local tourists should take advantage of the last days of the warm weather and explore the province. The GTA is launching its Easter programme in Zonderwater in Cullinan and Dinokeng in Tshwane. Cullinan is a vibrant town that attracts international and domestic tourists. Board chairperson of the GTA, Judi Nwokedi says they are on the road to recovery as the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions have been lifted. “A focus of the recovery programme for Gauteng Tourism and tourism in the country is really focused on the local Gautenger exploring the exciting, amazing opportunities that are there in the province, from Dinokeng to the Cradle to Cullinan. It will take you 50 minutes from Joburg to get out here where you will experience the big five, beautiful lodges, Cullinan where there is the only operational diamond mine.”
