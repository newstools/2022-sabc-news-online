National Police Commissioner, Fannie Masemola, has asked Gauteng Police Commissioner, Elias Mawela, to submit a report on the arrest of Advocate Malesela Teffo. Teffo, who’s one of the defence lawyers in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial, was arrested when the Meyiwa case was adjourned on Thursday afternoon at the Pretoria High Court on Thursday. Teffo’s attorney, Timothy Thobane, says Teffo was facing a charge of trespassing, but that had been cancelled.  The warrant is understood to have been issued in January. Teffo represents four of the accused in the Meyiwa trial. Police spokesperson,  Athlenda Mathe says: “National Commissioner of the South African Police Service (SAPS), General Fannie Masemola takes note of the arrest of Advocate Malesela Teffo. General Masemola has since been made aware that there is a warrant of arrest for Advocate Teffo and has henceforth requested the Provincial Commissioner of Gauteng, Lieutenant General Elias Mawela to submit a report on the matter.”
