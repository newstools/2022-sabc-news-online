Co-workers and family of OR Tambo District Municipality employee, Namhla Mtwa, who was gunned down in her driveway in Mthatha last week, are struggling to come to terms with the murder. Mtwa, who worked in the Budget and Treasury Office at the municipality, was allegedly shot by a hitman, as she arrived home from work last week Thursday. The Mtwa family wants justice for their daughter. Family spokesperson Thembakazi Mtwa says, “Pulling the trigger at a close range, and I swear, I swear that he makes sure that he is killing her. That man wanted to make sure that she is dead, she is dead and I was just outside crying, calling people, calling people because I see this man was killing her.” “I want justice to be served here in South Africa, many of our kids have been killed, especially women. I do not understand how you can kill, how can you shoot a helpless woman with a gun. I do not know, I do not understand it really, that is why I am asking the justice system to be served in this country,” added Mtwa. Her sister Sanga Nozintaba says Namhla feared for her life. Nozintaba says, “I am not going to let her rest and want her to fight, I want the person who took her life, I want her to fight this battle on her own. I am so hurt but I want her to fight, that is all I can say and I would like the government to help us find justice for her.” Eastern Cape police spokesperson Thembinkosi Kinana says the investigation into the brutal killing is under way. Kinana says, “According to the information the 35 year-old woman was arriving at her home, when she came under attack from an unknown suspect, who fired several shots and the woman died at the scene. The circumstances surrounding the incident are under the investigation, we have registered a case of murder.” No arrests have been made yet.
