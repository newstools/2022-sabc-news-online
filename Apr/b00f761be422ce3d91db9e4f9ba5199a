The Premier Soccer League (PSL) says it is leaving nothing to chance with the anticipation of the return of fans to the stadiums this weekend. The PSL Executive Committee held a meeting in Johannesburg earlier on Tuesday with the MEC’s of Health and Sport from all the nine provinces. The purpose of the meeting was to ensure the seamless return of crowds to soccer matches, after an absence of more than two years due to COVID-19 restrictions.

Those that forgot to vaccinate, the facilities are made available for them. We thought it is maybe convenient that as we are moving forward, challenging the government to open all the stadia 100%.” “Let us not have excuse from government that we are not sure about your [vaccination] status. We are encouraging people. We are not forcing people to make sure that our message is strengthened, we are seen to be doing the right thing,” adds Khoza. Government has promised to provide vaccination sites for unvaccinated soccer fans at different match venues, as well as at ticket outlets. Limpopo Health MEC, Phophi Ramathuba says they will also help download vaccination certificates for those that could not do it. “We will be having sites, vaccination sites where you will be buying your tickets, you should be expecting us to be there. We will be there to offer the vaccines. Not only will we stop there at the stadium, we will be having our vaccination sites there, ready to offer the vaccines.” “We will be having our data capturers, our volunteers who will be there for those who have vaccinated, who do not have the certificates. We will be able to download the certificates for them,” adds Ramathuba.
