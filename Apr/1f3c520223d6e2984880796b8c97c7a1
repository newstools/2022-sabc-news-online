SA National Defence Force (SANDF) Chief General Rudzani Maphwanya says there is relative stability in Cabo Delgado in Mozambique. The SANDF is part of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) mission in the northern parts of the country. Maphwanya briefed the media about developments in Cabo Delgado. The SADC mission has been deployed since last year to deal with terrorism and violent extremism. The SADC mission in Mozambique has recorded milestones in repelling terror attacks in Cabo Delgado. General Maphwanya says they have also won the hearts and minds of Mozambicans, who want peace and security restored in their country. “Since its deployment Samim has registered a number of milestones including recapturing of villages, bringing back members that were displaced and dislodging terrorists, and seizing weapons. Samim had brought relative stability.”  Maphwanya says the SADC region had also deployed the mission to tackle the scourge of terrorism, but most importantly, this was done to avoid spillover to other countries in a region that prides itself on stability. “You will be fooling yourself if you think issues affecting your neighbours won’t affect you and therefore we believe we must curb the scourge of terrorism, eventually it will affect the entire region.” Meanwhile, Maphwanya says they have dispatched its aircraft in KwaZulu-Natal to assist after the coastal province was ravaged by flooding. “We have operations that we conduct we have operation chariot, immediately when we were informed we could lift goods and airforce is providing air support.” SANDF says the issue of budgetary constraints must be addressed to be able to execute its missions.
