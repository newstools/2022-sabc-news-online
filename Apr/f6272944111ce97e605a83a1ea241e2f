The family of Phumzile Qata, a slain eThekwini water department official, wants answers. Police in KwaZulu-Natal, who are still investigating the murder, say no one has been arrested. The motive is also unknown at this stage. Qata was gunned down at work at the Ottawa water depot at the weekend. A family member, who is speaking on condition of anonymity, says they are pinning their hopes on police investigations. “Our sister never complained about anything [or about] receiving death threats at work. She used to tell us that it’s extremely busy after the floods. We are looking for answers as to why she was killed. Our hopes lie on police investigations to shed light [on] who killed her [and] for what,” explains this family member.” Meanwhile, the eThekwini Municipality is calling for the speedy arrest of the gunmen. The incident comes at a time when many areas in eThekwini are without water following severe damage to roads and infrastructure caused by the recent deadly floods.
