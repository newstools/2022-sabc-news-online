Nurses at the Kwangcolosi Clinic in Hillcrest west of Durban, say they fear the clinic may have to close temporarily as the area is among several in and around the eThekwini Municipality that have lost water supply following flood damages. Umgeni Water has confirmed that a rock-fall has caused severe damage to its Durban Heights Water Treatment plant, causing supply disruptions. Matron Nonhlanhla Msibi says she does not know how long they will be able to keep their doors open. “It affected the area badly. I would say more than worse. The way it is there is no road as you can see the pipes that delivers water to reservoir is all broken. As it is in the clinic, we are relying on the water from tanks that were installed. I don’t know if it gets finished what are we going to do. But in the meantime we are sustained by that water.” Efforts to restore water supply Water and Sanitation Minister Senzo Mchunu says his department is working hard to restore water in areas that floods have affected in KwaZulu-Natal. Several communities have been left without water. Mchunu told the media in Durban on Friday that technicians are repairing damaged water infrastructure. “There are ideas, one idea is to pull water from Inanda Dam that is abstract water and then feed it into the system that goes to Durban heights which will quicken the process. Once they decided that they’ll have to operate on that immediately and then fill up and that will enable the team to start repairing the two main pipes immediately. Maybe temporarily but of course there will be time for rebuilding.” Ministers brief the media in KZN:
