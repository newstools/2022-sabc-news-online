Tyson Fury emerged unscathed from a turbulent fight week to cement his place among the greats of heavyweight boxing with a stunning TKO win over Dillian Whyte Saturday (April 23) night in what “The Gypsy King” said would be his final bout. Fury had to face a barrage of questions about his relationship with Daniel Kinahan, his former advisor and one of three men named as leaders of the Kinahan organised crime gang recently sanctioned by U.S. authorities. The British boxer engaged in a number of combative interviews in the lead-up to his bout with Whyte, saying Kinahan’s situation was none of his business and that he had nothing to do with the Irishman. All that was forgotten on Saturday as Fury entered the ring and unloaded a sixth-round uppercut that left Whyte unable to continue in the opinion of the referee. The vast majority of the Wembley Stadium crowd roared their approval as Fury went from zero to hero again. Fury said that he would be sticking to his promise to his wife to retire, with promoter Frank Warren backing the 33-year-old’s decision to call it quits.
