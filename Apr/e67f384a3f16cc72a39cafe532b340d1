Political analyst Doctor Ralph Mathekga has described the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court’s sentencing of former Social Development Minister and ANC Women’s League President Bathabile Dlamini as a milestone in South Africa’s justice system. On Frida, the court sentenced Dlamini to four years imprisonment or a fine of R200 000 with half of the sentence suspended. The case relates to Dlamini’s testimony at an inquiry that the Constitutional Court had established into her role in the social grant crisis in the 2017. The inquiry investigated whether Dlamini should be held personally liable for the costs of the South African Social Security Agency debacle. In the report below, perjury offence lands Dlamini with 4 year sentence or R200 000 fine:  She was found guilty last month. Mathekga says the court has set a precedent that senior politicians are not above the law. “It’s a very strong conviction for politicians for something like this (to happen). We have not seen something like this before. It sets a precedent about the conduct of those that are part of the executive. People might compare it to others, but I think given the fact that someone here is being convicted of this crime, someone who has had political cover for that and the court has pierced through that and has said that look we are going to convict you, it is a very, very strong statement.” Dlamini elaborates in the video below: Meanwhile the Congress of the People (COPE) says it is disappointed with the sentence handed down to former Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini. COPE Spokesperson Dennis Bloem says perjury is a serious crime. “We had expected that she will be sentenced to a jail term without a fine. Perjury is a very serious offence and must be treated as such. Nevertheless, we accept the sentence. It once again gives hope that our courts are independent.”
