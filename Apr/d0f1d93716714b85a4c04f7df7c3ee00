Eskom has announced it will reduce rolling blackouts to Stage 2 starting at 10pm until Friday evening. It follows the return to service of generation units at the Majuba, Matimba and the Arnot power stations. One unit at Tutuka Power Station was shut down for repairs. Two more units are set to return to service during the next 24 hours. Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says the expected lower weekend demand for electricity made it possible for Eskom to reduce rolling blackouts to Stage 2. Analysis of the current Eskom power cuts:
