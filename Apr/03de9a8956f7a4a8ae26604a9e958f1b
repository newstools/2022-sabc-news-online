I’m sad that I never had the chance to meet her or work with her. I would have loved to hear her thoughts about wokeness. My condolences to her family and friends.https://t.co/1aRqCe6Cbm — Richard Wilkinson (@wilkinsoncape) April 16, 2022  Oh no! RIP Rhoda. An extraordinary woman. Condolences to her family.
