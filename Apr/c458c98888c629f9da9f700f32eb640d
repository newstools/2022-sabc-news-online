President Cyril Ramaphosa says criminality will not be condoned. This was in the wake of the murder of Zimbabwean national Elvis Nyathi in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, in the early hours of Thursday morning. The President, speaking to SABC News on the sidelines of the Heads of Mission Conference in Pretoria on Thursday, says law enforcement authorities are keeping a close eye on developments. “The Minister [of Police Bheki Cele] was there last [Wednesday] night to help calm the situation. We will not condone any criminality and form of criminality which results in the death of one. It is not acceptable and we will take action to deal with it,” adds President Ramaphosa. Cele was in the area again today following days of violence with locals accusing foreign nationals of being behind escalating crime in the area. It’s believed the mob arrived at Elvis Nyathi’s house after 10 PM and shouted where are your passports. He was then dragged from here, pelted with stones, and was set alight.
