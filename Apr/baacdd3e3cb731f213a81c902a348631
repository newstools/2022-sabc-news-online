The City of Tshwane says it will prioritise the electricity grid and water infrastructure for the 2022/2023 financial year. This includes the refurbishment of the Mooikloof and Wapadrand substations which are prone to tripping. Mayor Randal Williams delivered his State of the City address on Thursday morning. Williams says R134-million has been invested into the refurbishment project that will see various substations operate efficiently. He says, “All these projects reaffirm our commitment to prioritise, refurbish and maintain our critical infrastructure to enable economic growth in Tshwane. We cannot encourage development and investment in our city without supply.” Basic services Williams says he’s confident that the city’s financial challenges will soon improve and make it possible to enhance the delivery of basic services to its residents. He says through the Tshwane Yatema Campaign, the city has managed to collect more than R 700-million in revenue, since November last year. Williams says more projects will soon be implemented to make sure that the more than R4-billion shortfall which the Democratic Alliance-led coalition inherited from the Gauteng Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs Department administrators becomes a thing of the past. He says, “We were able to collect more than R 700 million and we have continued to ensure that we maintain the momentum that we started earlier in the year. It’s a matter of public record that in November 2020 we inherited a large deficit of more than R4 billion  from the provincial administrators. Turning the city’s financial position has not been easy, but we are gradually making steady progress.” Singing of our National Anthem by @TMPDSafety and Tshwane EMS.#TshwaneSoCA22 pic.twitter.com/8ZtUeidK4m — City of Tshwane (@CityTshwane) April 21, 2022  #TshwaneSoCA22 pic.twitter.com/Fy85EPRvQF — City of Tshwane (@CityTshwane) April 21, 2022  Additional reporting by Abongile Dumako.
