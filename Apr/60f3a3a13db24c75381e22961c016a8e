Transnet says the Durban Car Terminal has broken its annual record having handled a total of 531 755 fully built units over the 12-months, ended March 2022. According to Kwazi Mabaso, Acting Managing Executive at the Durban Terminals, Recovery from COVID-19 is happening sooner than expected in the automotive industry. The terminal’s volumes had dwindled to 323 300 fully built units handled in the COVID19 year ended March 2021. Import volumes contributed 53% of overall volumes comprising mainly of entry-level cars. There has also been a surge in transhipments as the appetite for second-hand cars within South Africa and neighbouring countries continues to grow. Second-hand cars imported solely for the South African market made up 2% of overall volumes.
