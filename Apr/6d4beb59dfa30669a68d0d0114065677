Parliament has exonerated former Health Minister Zweli Mkhize against allegations that he breached the Code of Ethical Conduct and Disclosure of Members Interests. The findings by Parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on Ethics and Members’ Interests, relates to the multi-million rand Digital Vibes tender. DA MP Siviwe Gwarube lodged a complaint to the Ethics Committee asking for Mkhize to be investigated. She claimed that Mkhize violated the code of conduct for members of Parliament by failing to declare that his family had benefited from the tender. This emanated from the findings of the Special Investigating Unit’s report which was submitted to President Cyril Ramaphosa, implicating Mkhize.  The Joint Committee on Ethics and Member’s Interests has cleared former Minister of Health Zweli Mkhize on both accounts of the allegations levelled against him. In the first part of the allegations it says Mkhize’s son does not fall within the definition of an immediate family according to the code of conduct as he is not financially dependent on his father. It also says based on evidence provided to the committee-Mkhize’s son was the one who was in communication with the service provider including the person who was in charge of all the payments. The committee says against this background it could not found Mkhize to have breached the Code of Ethical conduct and disclosure of members interests. Mkhize who has since resigned as the cabinet minister is still challenging the SIU report in court.
