Advocate Malesela Teffo says he has been arrested on a fraudulent warrant. The warrant is understood to have been issued in January. Teffo told the SABC his previous warrant of arrest was cancelled. “I’ve been arrested on a fraudulent warrant of arrest which according to what was obtained on the 27th of January this year. I got a cancellation of a warrant of arrest on the 28th of December last year with my attorney. So this one I was not even aware I was supposed to come to court and in so far as an allegation of trespassing. I was arrested in 2020 and that allegation of trespassing was withdrawn. I made legal representation, it was withdrawn on the 21st of December in 2021,” says Teffo.

Thabane says, “Can you imagine while you’re at home someone calls you and asks if you know a particular acting judge, then if you ask why you are asking me that question,then he drops the phone, the next thing he calls again then I can hear paperwork on the take. In one day I received five calls, during lunch we received a tip that they want to arrest my advocate. Those are intimidation tactics.”  LISTEN Adv Malesela Teffo sent #SAfmBTH producer @miss_andisa this voicenote while in detention at the Hillbrow Police station.
