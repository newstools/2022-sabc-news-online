The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Northern Cape says the livelihood of the people of Renosterberg Municipality, which comprises Vanderkloof, Petrusville and Phillips town, depends on the intervention of the national government. The party says it has decided to approach the National Council of Provinces and the office of President Cyril Ramaphosa following failed attempts to secure a meeting with the provincial government. DA member of provincial legislature Harold McGluwa says services in the municipality have collapsed. “The failure of the Northern Cape to intervene in the collapsed Renosterberg Municipality has left the DA with no option but to call on President Cyril Ramaphosa to institute section 139 -7 intervention. The situation is dire, the municipality is at a standstill, services are no existent.”
