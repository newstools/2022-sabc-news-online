ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa paid a courtesy visit to the Zion Christian Church in Limpopo earlier on Thursday. Ramaphosa, who was accompanied by some ANC NEC members as well as Provincial leaders of the party in the province, met with Reverend Bishop Dr Barnabas Lekganyane as well as Reverend Bishop Dr Joseph Lekgayane. Ramaphosa’s visit coincides with the Easter weekend festivities in which members of the Christian faith celebrate. Ramaphosa commended the two church leaders for providing leadership and saving lives amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and indicated that there would be consultations with the churches post the National State of Disaster to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Another issue that was discussed during the meeting was the devastation of the floods in KwaZulu-Natal that have claimed the lives of over 300 people. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula has urged holidaymakers to travel during the day, as volumes are expected to increase ahead of the easter weekend. Traffic authorities say it is safe to travel during the day than at night. Mbalula made the comments while monitoring the normally busy N1 highway. He says traffic volumes are down. Mbalula says police visibility will be high with speed traps and alcohol level testing taking place along major routes. “Normally this place will be chock-a-block with busses, and heavy vehicles, light vehicles, going to Moria, to the church, and then others will be going for vacations and so on. The traffic is normal, and that goes also for the N3. So, the volumes of traffic are basically down. We can say because it is Easter, because ZCC congregants are not taking their normal trip.”
