KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the disaster burial policy adopted by the Provincial Executive Council will assist families of flood victims. Zikalala was giving an update on the province’s response to the floods. Heavy rains resulted in extensive flooding and damage to homes, businesses and public infrastructure in the province. He says the death toll stands a 435 with 54 people still missing. “In this regard, we appreciate the contribution by Avbob which has set aside 3 million to assist with burial cost of about 150 people. We are also heavily indebted to the Motsepe Family Foundation, which has generously donated 30 million to be used largely to cover burial costs.” Premier Sihle Zikalala gives latest update in the aftermath of floods: Damages Durban and surrounding areas were the worst affected. Early estimates indicate that the losses in the agricultural sector amount to at least R500 million. Repairs to road infrastructure to move produce from farms were identified as one of the most urgent interventions. The provincial government said its main priority was to save lives and provide humanitarian assistance. While recovery efforts continue, relief organisations, churches, and communities continue to assist those in need.
According to the government, work was being done to clear roads, bridges, and other public infrastructure. The container terminals in the port of Durban are operating at 60 to 100%. Citrus exporters have welcomed the contingency plans made to allow trucks to access the harbour. Power supply has been restored to some areas in the Ethekwini Metro, according to the latest reports. While water supply has been restored in some areas, municipalities are ensuring that emergency water supplies and water tankers reach areas where repairs are ongoing.
