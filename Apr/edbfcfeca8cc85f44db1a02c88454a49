Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) President Velenkosini Hlabisa says they will support KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala in leading the province through these difficult times. Hlabisa was addressing the provincial day of prayer for flood victims in Durban. The floods have killed at least 448 people. More than 400 others are still unaccounted for. Hlabisa says tough times lie ahead for the province. He says, “As the province and as people and as the nation we have to brace ourselves for a tough road ahead rising from the ashes. And at this given time we will give you support in leading the province of KwaZulu-Natal. This is time to love time to care this is time to show our civil service that we must take things seriously for our people.” Religious leaders Speaking at the prayer service, Reverend Vusi Dube said it was important for religious leaders to be on the ground where communities needed them most. “What is more important for us as religious leaders again, we are going to go to those places give counselling, to talk to those people because they are in tears. When you begin to talk with them they break down in tears because they don’t know from here where to start, so we’re very glad that the premier has called us to bring hope to the people of KwaZulu-Natal just to say we’re here as government, we are here to hear their cries.” In the video below, Dube says the families are struggling to get access to needs such as water:
