Traffic has been severely affected on the N2 south bound at the Tugela River on the KwaZulu-Natal North Coast following a crash between a truck and a bakkie. It’s alleged the truck collided into a bakkie that was stationary in the emergency lane. One person has been critically injured. Motorists are using the N2 as an alternative route since the Old Main Road, R102, that passes uThongathi was damaged during the floods. RTI Spokesperson, Zinhle Mali says, “One person sustained serious injuries following a collision involving a truck and a bakkie that was stationary in the emergency lane on the N2 south bound Tugela River. Slow lane is obstructed. The injured was taken to hospital and RTI is busy controlling traffic in that area. There is a huge backlog of traffic in that area.” Meanwhile, four people have been discharged from the Barkley West Hospital in the Northern Cape following a fatal crash that claimed the lives of three people on Tuesday. The accident happened on the R31 Delportshoop Bridge which involved four vehicles. Police say preliminary investigations indicate a vehicle wanted to overtake a truck, but failed and collided with an oncoming traffic. Police Spokesperson, Timothy Sam elaborates says, “As an update on the culpable homicide case, whereby three persons died and five injured, in a pile-up accident that happened in Delportshoop Bridge to Ulco on Tuesday the 26th of April 2022. Four of the injured are discharged by the Barkley West Hospital on Wednesday the 27th of April 2022. One is transferred to Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe Hospital in kimberley for further investigation.”
