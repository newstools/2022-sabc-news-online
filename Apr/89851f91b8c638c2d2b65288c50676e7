At the time of his death, he was business manager at SABC’s Channel Africa. Luzuko Koti’s funeral service:  SABC Radio Group Executive Nada Wotshela says Koti displayed leadership skills from an early age. “We both joined the SABC in 1999, he was very supportive, very inspirational, he led a number of people and groomed them and made them fall in love with journalism. He was someone who wanted to achieve great things.” Friends and family have described Koti as a selfless person, a leader and a patriot. Keith Ngesi and Sipho Ngwema are both friends of Koti. “He encouraged people from their position of leadership and he is not someone who likes to shine. He gives the shine away. From his early childhood stage, Luzuko was a leader. “LZK loved South Africa. He had deep love for this country and he wanted to fix some of the problems he came across. Every time you will engage he will engage about how best to fix South Africa. What are the solutions but as a communicator he had great ideas. He was able to simplify things.”
