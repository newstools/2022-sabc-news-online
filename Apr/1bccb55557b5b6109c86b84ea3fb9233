“Eastern Cape Department of Health would like to sincerely apologise to the communities that have been affected by the illegal closure of some health facilities in the Nelson Mandela Bay region. Workers are demanding that the department address staff shortages something that the department is doing for the current financial year. More than R700 million has been budgeted to feel more than 2 700 vacancies throughout the province. We are calling on the workers to end the unprotected strike action and allow recruitment processes to unfold.”
