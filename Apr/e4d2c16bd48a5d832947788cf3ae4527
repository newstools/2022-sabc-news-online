She’s got over 30 years’ worth of dedication and perseverance, putting her on a higher pedestal. Her groundbreaking research demonstrated that antiretroviral can also prevent the sexual transmission of HIV. History Professor Paul Maylam says, “Very few people have done the work that she has. She hung on to her research into HIV. She serves as a role model to young prospective female scientists. As there is still a big challenge.” According to University of Rhodes Vice-Chancellor Sizwe Mabizela, young women are dominating this season’s graduation. “On other important news, 60% of graduates in this ceremony are women, ‘malibongwe igama labafazi’.
