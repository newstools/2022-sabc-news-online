Eskom has reiterated its call for the public to help limit the impact of power cuts by reducing electricity usage over the Easter Weekend. Stage 2 rolling blackouts will continue until five o’clock on Friday morning. Eskom’s Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha says any further deterioration in generation capacity may result in further power cuts next week. “The power system remains fragile and while that holds, Eskom will continue with the current instance of load shedding as previously communicated which will be suspended at 5AM on Friday. We do inform the public that any further deterioration in generation capacity may require further load shedding. We, therefore, request the public to continue using electricity sparingly, particularly over the long weekend to assist to replenish the emergency generation reserves in anticipation of the coming week,” says Mantshantsha.
