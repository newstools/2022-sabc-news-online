Wilfried Zaha scored a last-gasp winner as Crystal Palace came from behind to claim a 2-1 win at Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday. With the game seemingly headed for a draw, substitute Zaha latched onto a pass from James McArthur at the edge of the box in the second minute of stoppage time and squeezed in a fine low finish. Earlier, the hosts took the lead through Oriol Romeu in the ninth minute when the Spaniard headed home from a James Ward-Prowse corner before Palace’s Conor Gallagher spurned a great chance to equalise minutes later as he put his free header wide. Eberechi Eze, who had looked threatening for Palace in the first half, levelled the match on the hour mark with a cushioned left-footed finish past Fraser Forster, who had palmed away Jordan Ayew’s dangerous cross minutes earlier. Palace are 12th in the standings with 41 points, one ahead of Southampton in 15th.
