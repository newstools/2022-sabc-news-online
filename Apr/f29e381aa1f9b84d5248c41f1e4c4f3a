The new Chief Justice, Raymond Zondo, will be presiding over a closed session of the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) in Sandton, Johannesburg on Monday. The meeting will discuss the mandate of the body. It comes ahead of a weeklong of JSC interviews to fill vacant positions on the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of Appeal, and several High courts across the country. Top jurists have applied for the jobs. However, the way the commission does its work has been in the spotlight as Lawson Naidoo of the Council for the Advancement of the South African Constitution explains. “Last year April’s JSC interviews were taken to court over the manner it was done. It ended up being redone due to this.” Another lobby group, Judges Matter, has also been keeping a close watch on the JSC. Spokesperson for the group, Mbekezeli Benjamin, points out some criticism levelled at the commission. “There were some concerns in the manner in which interviewees were asked questions, also no consistency in amount of time.” In February this year, during the interviews held to appoint the new Chief Justice of the country, there were calls for some commissioners to recuse themselves. Judge Johann Kriegler speaks for the group, Freedom Under Law, “Commissioners [Julius] Malema and [Adv Dali] Mpofu should have recused themselves as they are facing their own disciplinary hearings over their conduct.” In response to the growing criticism, there’ll be some changes to this round of JSC interviews. In addition to new faces as commissioners, a special session on guidelines will be held prior to the interviews. JSC to interview candidates for vacant ConCourt seats – Adv Alan Dodson:
