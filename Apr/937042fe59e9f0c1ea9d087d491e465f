Three men convicted of a farm murder have been given life in prison by the High Court in Polokwane, Limpopo. The convicts, all Zimbabwean nationals, were found guilty of killing farmer Petrus van Zyl outside Bela-Bela in March 2020. The murderers, Ugenius Saga, Tatenda Ngwenya and Lloyd Mandumbu were also given lesser sentences on other charges, which will run concurrently with the life terms. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has welcomed the sentence saying it will serve as a deterrent.
