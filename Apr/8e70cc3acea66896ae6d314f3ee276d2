The Gauteng Transport Department and the Joburg Roads Agency (JRA) have ended their relationship that had seen the JRA design, install, repair, and maintain traffic signals on behalf of the provincial department. Joburg Transport MMC Funzi Ngobeni says the parties could not reach a consensus to renew the service level agreement. The agreement would have seen the JRA continue repairing and maintaining 231 signalised intersections on provincial roads across the City of Johannesburg. Gauteng Public Transport and Roads Infrastructure MEC Jacob Mamabolo expressed concern over the JRA not having its tax affairs in order, a dispute which is going through legal processes. Ngobeni’s spokesperson Olebogeng Molatlhwa says, “Effective 1 April 2022, JRA began attending only to the 1 992 signalised intersections under its jurisdiction while the provincial department will attend to queries related to its traffic signals. MMC Ngobeni reiterates that this decision was not easy but was necessary for transparency.” The video below is a report on road improvement partnerships:
