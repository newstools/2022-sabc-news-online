The long-awaited African National Congress’ eThekwini regional conference gets underway this weekend with the registration of delegates being done on Friday. The region has been without an elected leadership for four years after its term of office lapsed in 2018. The leadership race for the chairperson is expected to be between former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede, who stepped aside due to corruption charges, and the Speaker in the city, Thabani Nyawose. Former eThekwini Mayor Zandile Gumede briefly appeared before the Durban High Court last week: The ANC’s Provincial Secretary Mdumiseni Ntuli says they expect a successful conference. “We are quite comfortable as the PEC in terms of preparedness. There are comrades who have been nominated. I think there are two distinct line-ups in terms of the top five, one led by comrade Zandile Gumede and the other led by comrade Thabani Nyawose.” Ntuli adds: “We are very happy that all groups seem to be very keen to ensure that the conference takes place, that nobody seems to be having a sense of discomfort or opposed to the processes leading up to the conference.“
