The newly-elected African National Congress Treasurer in Mpumalanga Mandla Msibi has agreed to step aside. That is according to ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe. This comes after ANC officials wrote to Msibi, requesting him to write a letter alerting them that he is stepping aside. During his closing address at the 13th Mpumalanga Elective Conference last weekend, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa appealed to the newly-elected provincial leadership and the party members to deal with the issue, as Msibi is facing murder and attempted murder charges. Mabe says Msibi has agreed to adhere to the ANC regulation. “The information I have and what we are aware of is that indeed he had agreed that he will be stepping aside from that position. Comrade Mandla even in the initial stages of the case when the issues of the charges first came into the public, he took that stand all by himself, advised the PEC of him stepping aside owing to the case.” Mabe says the party appreciates Msibi’s decision to adhere to the rule.
