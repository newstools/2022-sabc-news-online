DJ Black Coffee has described winning his first Grammy award as overwhelming. South Africa’s most successful DJ who returned Tuesday night, got the award for the best dance-electronic album at the 64th Grammy Awards on Monday morning. Black Coffee, whose real name is Nathi Maphumulo, won for his album ‘Subconsciously’. The renowned music producer is the first South African to be nominated and win in the category. He accepted the award with his eldest son, Esona. “I’m just so overwhelmed right now I can’t even explain it, it’s just such a crazy feeling. You know when you sit alone as a human being and wonder if you died, would you know who loved you and what would people say about you, I’m experiencing that moment right now. I’m seeing the love, I’m seeing the support and it’s like I’m watching from somewhere. This is such an amazing feeling, I was thinking about it on the plane. And I was thinking, I wish I could just fly around the continent and sprinkle it so that everyone could just feel this feeling.” Black Coffee received a hero’s welcome when he arrived at the OR Tambo International Airport. Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa who was also there to welcome Black Coffee said the artist has demonstrated that he has the power to bring his music not only to the people of South Africa but also to the rest of the world. “Following in the footsteps of Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, DJ Black Coffee has reached the top of his game and will continue to shine. You are an icon and your love for music and youth should continue for years to come,” says Mthethwa. President Cyril Ramaphosa has also congratulated Black Coffee on winning the award:
