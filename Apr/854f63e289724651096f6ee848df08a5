The police in Westenburg, Polokwane in Limpopo, have arrested a 33-year-old suspect for allegedly shooting and killing a manager of a car dealership at Nirvana on Monday afternoon.  The suspect and an accomplice also allegedly robbed the dealership of a luxury car. Police say the two men arrived at the dealership pretending to buy a car. They produced a firearm and demanded keys from the manager.  The 57-year-old manager was subsequently shot dead before the suspects fled the scene in the stolen vehicle. One of the suspects was arrested near the Peter Mokaba stadium with the vehicle.  Two firearms were found inside the car.  The second suspect is still on the run.
