Seven men accused of the murder of Zimbabwean national Elvis Nyathi are expected to be back in the Randburg Magistrate’s Court on Monday to make a formal bail application. Nyathi was beaten and burnt to death in Diepsloot earlier in April. The seven men face charges of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and extortion. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says although 14 arrests had initially been made, they are confident that the seven men before the court are the correct accused. The state intends to oppose bail. ZANU-PF in SA condemns the murder ZANU-PF in South Africa has condemned the murder.
