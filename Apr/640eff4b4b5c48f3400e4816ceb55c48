The African National Congress (ANC) has admitted that its step-aside rule has not been clear on the seriousness of cases that warrant members who are facing criminals charges in courts to step down. The party’s Secretary-General Ace Magashule was suspended after refusing to step-aside pending the finalisation of his fraud and corruption case. Although the party’s Women’s League President Bathabile Dlamini was sentenced to four years with an option of a fine yesterday, she neither stepped down nor resigned since she was convicted of perjury. In the report below, perjury offence lands Dlamini with 4 year sentence or R200 000 fine:  Acting ANC Secretary-General Paul Mashatile spoke to SABC News on the sidelines of the wreath-laying ceremony at Winnie Madikizela-Mandela’s grave in Fourways north of Johannesburg. Mashatile says they will meet the party’s convicted Women’s League President on Monday to decide her fate. The Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court yesterday sentenced Dlamini to four years in jail with an option of a R200 000 fine with half of the sentence suspended. Currently, the governing ANC has a standing resolution that all members who are facing criminal charges have to step-aside and those convicted must resign. But Dlamini has neither been suspended nor resigned. Mashatile says they are still studying the judgment. The court found Dlamini guilty of perjury last month. The ANC NEC is expected to meet to discuss Dlamini’s fate after her conviction and sentencing. Dlamini elaborates in the video below:
