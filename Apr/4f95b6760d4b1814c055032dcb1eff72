Judge nominee for the vacant position in the High Court’s Free State Division, Advocate Ilse van Rhyn, says that while there are fewer constitutional matters brought before the Court, they are confronted with constitutional issues on a daily basis. Van Rhyn is the second of the three nominees who told the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) that very few constitutional matters are brought before the High Court in Bloemfontein. The other two nominees were Advocate Johannes Hefer and Cathy Page. Van Rhyn, who had various acting stints as a judge, elaborates on the kind of constitutional issues they are confronted with during other matters brought to the court. She says, “In a criminal matter I did during the last term, I had a situation where the accused put up his hand (on) the second day of the trial and indicated that he is not feeling well.” “It was a murder case, the case didn’t involve constitutional matters but at that stage the accused right to a fair trial, the accused’s right to obtain medical assistance. So I’m trying to explain that we get constitutional issues daily. You are confronted with those issues but at the end of the day the trial or the application does not involve exclusively constitutional issues,” Van Rhyn explains. Meanwhile, the JSC has advised that President Cyril Ramaphosa appoint Van Rhyn to fill the vacant judge position in the Free State Division of the High Court. JSC co-spokesperson Doris Tshepe made the announcement in a short media briefing on Thursday afternoon. Tshepe says, “As you are aware the Judicial Service Commission just interviewed three candidates for one vacancy at the Free State Division of the High Court Following the deliberation the JSC will advise the President to appoint adv I van Rhyn as the judge of the Free State Division of the High Court.” JudiciaI Service Commission Interviews | 7 April 2022:
