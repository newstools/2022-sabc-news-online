The coordinator of the African National Congress Youth League National Task Team, Nonceba Mhlawuli has called on ANC leaders to stop defending wrong things that are happening in the party. She says the election of Mandla Msibi as ANC Treasurer in Mpumalanga this past weekend should not have happened. Msibi is facing a double murder charge in a Nelspruit Court. Mhlawuli says it is anti-ANC to see leaders standing up and justifying Msibi’s election. She says the resolutions of the party’s 54th elective conference are clear on the step aside rule. Speaking at the Mamelodi West Cemetery in Pretoria, during the commemoration of the death of Solomon Mahlangu, who died in 1979 under the Apartheid Regime, the youth league coordinator says, “We do it every single day. Just this past weekend we justified the election of someone who is in court for a particular offence and we had to stand up and comrade Gwen and everyone stood in front of the media and justified that action.” On Monday Mandla Msibi, the newly elected Treasurer of the ANC in Mpumalanga has been requested to step aside. Pule Mabe on Mpumalanga Treasurer Msibi stepping aside, Bathabile Dlamini’s fate:  The ANC national officials wrote a letter to Msibi, stating that he must write a letter, alerting them he will be stepping aside from his position which he has only occupied for a few days. Msibi is facing double murder charges and is expected in a High Court in Nelspruit, later this year. The ANC in Mpumalanga held its 13th Provincial elective conference last weekend which saw Mandla Ndlovu becoming the chairperson, his deputy, Speedy Mashilo.
