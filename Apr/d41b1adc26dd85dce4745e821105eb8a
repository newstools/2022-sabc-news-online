Eskom says the country is unlikely to experience rolling blackouts for the rest of the week. According to the power utility, Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha predicts that electricity consumption will remain stable over the next few days, saying power cuts are not expected for the rest of this week. “In the peak of winter, Eskom will be able to supply 35-thousand megawatts to the country, which generally is sufficient to get rid of load shedding, but that is only during that period. Currently, Eskom is able with much difficulty to supply only 30-thousand megawatts of electricity and should we have breakdowns – that is when you get such a statement. We will continue to have this constrained system until we are able as a country to have new generation capacity added, which is power stations being built.” Eskom Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha:  Eskom escalated rolling blackouts to Stage 4 last week, following a further deterioration of generation capacity.
