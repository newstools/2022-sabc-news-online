The Department of Correctional Services says it is investigating allegations that one of the accused in the Senzo Meyiwa murder case was assaulted by a prison warder at the High Court in Pretoria. Advocate Malesela Teffo, representing accused number 3 Carlos Mncube claims his client was assaulted in court cells this week. Mncube and four others were appearing in what was scheduled to be the start of the trial into the death of the soccer sensation. Correctional Services says it’s been made aware of the allegations and the outcome of the investigation will determine any further course of action. Meyiwa’s murder case was postponed yet again. The lawyer for accused number five asked that the matter stand down until April 22 to allow them to further prepare for the case. The postponement was based on the argument that they have to consult defence witnesses on statements given to them by the State two weeks ago, which they say was at the 11th hour. Advocate Zandile Mshololo argued it was in the interest of justice to be granted another postponement on Tuesday. Mshololo wanted to consult with witnesses in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng.  Her client Sifisokuhle Ntuli and four other alleged hitman are accused of killing Orlando Pirates Goal Keeper Senzo Meyiwa in 2014. Meyiwa was gunned down in his partner Kelly Khumalo’s mother’s house in Vosloorus. The accused, Muzikawulahlelwa Sibiya, Bongani Ntanzi, Mthobisi Mncube, Mthokosizeni Maphisa and Sifisokuhle Ntuli are contemplating an acquittal application as they strongly believe they’ve been wrongfully arrested.
