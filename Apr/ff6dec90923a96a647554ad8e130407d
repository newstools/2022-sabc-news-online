The Democratic Alliance DA) has called for stability in the Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB) Metro in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape. The party has described the situation as complex and unstable. This follows a dispute over who is the city manager in the metro. The party says it will attend the council meeting set for Tuesday to also stop the MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Xolile Nqatha from going ahead with his threat to place the metro under administration. Speaking to the media, the DA’s provincial chairperson Andrew Whitfield says they cannot rule out the possibility of returning to government in the metro but they will go into coalition when there is stability. He says they will raise all these issues during the council meeting scheduled for tomorrow. “The situation in Nelson Mandel Bay is incredibly complex and unstable and the DA is committed in taking decisions that will lead to stability and progress in the interest of residents, we will not be party in any actions that create instability in the metro. This means we will not prematurely rush into government for the sake of being in government, but we have set out very clear conditions about how we will go about and create a path back into government by bringing legal and procedural stability and certainty to the council. And these include an election of the speaker and obtaining legal clarity on who the valid city manager is.” Decision to appoint city manager rescinded
