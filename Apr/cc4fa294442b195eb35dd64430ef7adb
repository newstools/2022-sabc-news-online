Political analyst Bheki Mngomezulu says the election of Mandla Msibi as provincial treasurer of the African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga has created more confusion within the ranks of the party. Msibi has been elected as the ANC Treasurer while on step aside. He is facing a murder and two attempted murder charges. Mngomezulu says the ANC has to deliberate more on the step aside resolution as it is confusing. “But what becomes more interesting was the election of Mandla Msibi as the provincial treasury in the province. So that raises some questions. ..and in fact the president indicated that and raised these issues, basically appealing to the province to consider this and revisit the step aside policy, which means he is also aware that Mandla Msibi was not supposed to have been elected in a new position.” Ramaphosa’s remarks In his closing marks after the conference, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa said the issue of party’s step aside policy will need to be addressed vigorously by the newly elected leadership and the ANC branches. He said this forms part of the renewal project in the ANC. “You took the step of yes, endorsing and electing one of the comrades who is facing charges. Now, I know that you have reflected on this and you’re going to do further reflections. This matter does need your reflection as a disciplined membership of this organisation. Your reflection must be based on the decisions that have been taken by our national conference,” said Ramaphosa. During his address, Ramaphosa also denounced factionalsim and power struggles within the ANC. More details in the report below: -Additional reporting by Abongile Dumako
