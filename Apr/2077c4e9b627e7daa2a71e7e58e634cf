Families of people, who were washed away by floods in Durban, have called on the government to bring more members of search and rescue teams. This follows heavy rains, which claimed lives of 443 people in KwaZulu-Natal. Sixty three people are still missing. Search and Rescue teams from other provinces have been roped in to assist. The family of 53-year-old Msawakhe Dlamini who was washed away by floods at Ndlanzi north of Durban, says they want search and rescue teams to come and search for his body. The bodies of eight people have been found in ward 43 in Lindelani alone, while four other people are still missing. Ntokozo Dlamini says his uncle was washed away by floods while he was trying to cross over to a nearby house. “He was crossing over and the heavy current of water blew him away but the issue here is that the person has not been found and we need assistance, a rescue team to come and help us.” The floods have killed 443 people while thousands of people have been left displaced. The government declared a provincial state of disaster in KwaZulu-Natal. President Cyril Ramaphosa said the disaster “is part of climate change”, but many residents in the area blamed poor infrastructure for the scale of the flooding.
