Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe has yet again denied he had any dealings with Bosasa. The State Capture report implicated him in having dealings with the controversial company. Speaking at the 5th annual PGM Industry Day conference currently taking place in Johannesburg, Mantashe says, “I had dealings with an individual who was working with Bosasa and there were no security upgrades. I was putting cameras on my properties working with this young man. In hindsight, we discovered that it’s the property of Bosasa.“ “But the Zondo Commission reports they don’t test it because I represented myself. They check it and discover that they cannot find any prima-facie case of corruption in my name. It says somebody must go and look and find a case against me which they could not find.” Step aside Last month, while addressing the media, following the release of Part Three of the State Capture Commission report,  Mantashe said he will not step aside until a prima facie case against him has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The third part of the State Capture report focused on Bosasa and its dealings with the ANC and some senior government officials. Mantashe received free security installations at his properties, knowing that Bosasa director Papa Leshabane sought through him to influence unspecified or unnamed office bearers. But he said there is no prima facie case of wrongdoing against him. Mantashe vowed to take the report on judicial review. His lawyers are analysing the State Capture report. The report found overwhelming evidence that attempts were made through various forms of inducement to influence members of the National Executive, and office bearers, functionaries, officials, and employees in state institutions and organs of state.
