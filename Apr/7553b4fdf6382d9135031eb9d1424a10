The eThekwini Municipality is calling for the speedy arrest of gunmen who shot dead a city employee at the Water and Sanitation depot at Ottawa near Cornubia in Durban. The Metro says the 36-year-old female official was carrying out her daily duties at the water tanker filling depot when a group of unknown men shot her multiple times and sped off. The incident comes at a time when many areas in eThekwini are without water following severe damage to road and infrastructure caused by the recent deadly floods. Municipal Spokesperson Musawakhe Mayisela says, “Yes, our mayor is very shocked about this incident. (The mayor) is therefore calling upon our law enforcement agencies to move with speed and arrest those who are responsible for this crime. He’s appealing to anyone that may have information that will assist the police to come forward. He has also sent his heartfelt condolences to the family of the deceased and her colleagues.” Meanwhile, Humanitarian organisation, Gift of the Givers, has embarked on a partnership with Cape Town International Convention Centre to provide drinking water to the flood victims of KZN. The Convention Centre has made available a 5000 square meter venue as a drop off point for five-litres bottles of water. Ali Sabllay of Gift of the Givers says the public can deliver their water donations at the CTICC, everyday from 8 am to 5 pm until next week Friday. “As we know, the water is contaminated. There are still many people who are missing, who are lying in the rivers. So, the water is not suitable for human consumption, and with that many areas in the eThekwini Municipal districts are without clean drinking water. That’s why the pleas are coming in from the residents there. As we are speaking, many calls are coming through asking us for assistance. We’ve delivered truck loads of water from other provinces already. We are sending water from the Western Cape now.” KZN FLOODS | Gift of the Givers collects water for flood victims
