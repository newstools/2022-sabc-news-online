Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana says there’s a need for government to speed up its intervention plans in KwaZulu-Natal. Government released R1-billion in emergency funds on Friday to help tens of thousands of people left without shelter, water and power following devastating floods in the province. The floods have killed nearly 400 people. Godongwana says after the emergency relief stage, government will move to the first phase during which it will get professionals to make an assessment of the damages and the costs. He says the second phase will be recovery and repair. KZN FLOODS | Blame should be put on the doors of the government: Meanwhile, various government departments have continued to visit KwaZulu-Natal areas in which floods have affected families. Social Development Minister Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu is also in the province. “Families such as the Sibiya families who lost three family members and a 4-year-old who has not been found since their house was swept away were visited by the deputy minister.  Since the beginning of the tragedy, the department’s agency SASSA is providing social relief of distress in terms of food vouchers, school uniforms and blankets. The agency has now increased the cash benefit from R700 to R1 960 where there has been a loss of belongings. The value of a normal food voucher has been increased from R700 to R1200,” says Lumka Oliphant, Department of Social Development spokesperson. pic.twitter.com/u2U1KZMGyd — Hendrietta Bogopane Zulu (@HendriettaZ) April 16, 2022  Communities of Inanda, Ntuzuma and KwaMashu search for the bodies of loved ones: Additional reporting: Nonkululeko Hlophe
