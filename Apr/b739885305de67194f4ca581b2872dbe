Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies Khumbudzo Ntshavheni says Post Offices affected by the KwaZulu-Natal floods will be operational before the end of the month. The Tongaat and Rosburg Post Offices suffered flood damages. Ntshavheni assured the beneficiaries of social grants that the Post Office will make payments on schedule without any glitches. Ntshavheni says, “We only have the two Post Offices which is Rosburg in town and in Tongaat that have been severely damaged by water that have been shut down completely. We are going to do clean up. If I have it my way, I would say by this Friday they should come back.” “We also have nine post offices that have been affected either by shortage of water or where the electricity supply has been affected. But they are operational. That is why we are confident that we should be able to continue paying the grant in those Post Offices as normal for the payment of social grants,” adds Ntshavheni.
