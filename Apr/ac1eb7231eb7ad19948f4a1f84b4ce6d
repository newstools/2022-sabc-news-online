The family of an 11-year-old girl from Kimberley in the Northern Cape, who was murdered and dumped in a veld, is seeking justice. The girl went missing last week and her body was found days later. It is alleged that the girl was raped and choked. According to the family, the alleged perpetrator lured the young girl by promising her money. The suspect has since been arrested and is expected to appear in the Galeshewe Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Jennifer Le Roux is the aunt of the grade four pupil. “We want justice for Lebo. We want the perpetrator to be incarcerated and to get a life sentence because this little girl was brutally taken from life. My spirit can’t rest since the day I saw the body. It is sad.” Some residents of Kimberley have expressed anger and shock at the gruesome murder. Residents say the alleged perpetrator is known to his victim and the community.

“We have police who are meant to protect us. We can not live under these conditions where we are always afraid. If we don’t stand together, these things are going to continue.” “This Gender-Based Violence must come to an end. Every time these things happen, our law does not take its course so it is time for the community to stand up and say enough is enough, ” says some community members. Some residents are expected to march to the Galeshewe Magistrate’s Court in support of the family.
