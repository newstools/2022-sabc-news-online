Tunisia will work with other countries that have offered to help it to prevent environmental damage after a merchant ship carrying up to one thousand tonnes of oil sank in Tunisian waters, the defence ministry said on Sunday. The ship was heading from Equatorial Guinea to Malta when it sank seven miles off the coast of the southern city of Gabes on Friday. The Tunisian navy rescued all seven crew members following a distress call. It was carrying between 750 and one thousand tonnes of fuel, officials said. The defence ministry did not name the countries that had offered to help, but local media said Italy was expected to send a naval vessel specialised in dealing with marine disasters. “I want to confirm that there are no leaks and that the doors of the ship are safe, they are tightly closed and there is not even a leakage of the Qazoal (fuel) material that represents the shipment,” Tunisian transport minister Rabie Majidi told reporters. A specialised marine diving team has begun work around the ship to check for any oil leakage. On Saturday, Tunisian authorities opened an investigation into the sinking, which the environment ministry said was caused by bad weather. The coast of Gabes has suffered major pollution for years, with environmental organisations saying industrial plants in the area have been dumping waste directly into the sea.
