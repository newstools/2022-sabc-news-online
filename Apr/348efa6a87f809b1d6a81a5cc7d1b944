The South African government says it is going to deepen economic and political relations with Guinea Bissau. President Cyril Ramaphosa is going to host his Guinea Bissau counterpart President Umaro Embaló from Thursday. It’s going to be Embalo’s first state visit in the country. South Africa’s ambassador in Guinea Bissau Mphakama Mbete says this is an important meeting. “It’s important because the stronger our relations in the different sectors are that is between Ginea Bissau and South Africa the more it will have a positive effect on other countries in west Africa which as you know have problems in many areas of life.” Mbete says the country’s President Umaro Embaló wants to work with Pretoria to also strengthen their security. In the video below, UN SG expresses deep concern about news of heavy fighting in Guinea Bissau: This follows an attempted coup recently in the country. Mbete says many areas in that country need attention… “The area of defence is very important because among the problems they have had since their independence in 1973/1974 have been in the sector of defence and security. And I think this stronger relations they have established with South Africa I think the more it has positive effect on their security stability and political stability.”
