The Robben Island Museum says it will be revisiting a feasibility study for the building of a centre to house and exhibit some of the Robben Island artefacts currently being housed at the University of the Western Cape (UWC). Recent allegations have surfaced that some of the artefacts donated by former political prisoners had gone missing. Museum spokesperson, Melany Kuhn, says all the artefacts have been accounted for and are safe at the Mayibuye Archives Collection at UWC. Kuhn says, “We have been through this unfortunate incident, recognised the need for a stronger link between the artefacts currently held at the Mayibuye Archives Collections, and the people and communities where they have their roots.” “ To this end, Robben Island Museum is exploring other touch points where communities can have access to artefacts through additional exhibitions.”
