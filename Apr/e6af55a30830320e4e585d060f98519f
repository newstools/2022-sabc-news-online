The South African Association of Meat Importers and Exporters has called for the urgent removal of trade tariffs on all poultry products. The association is concerned that the increase in chicken prices will harm lower-income households. Chicken is the most affordable source of protein for the majority of households in South Africa. However, with the ever-increasing prices, chicken is slowly becoming a luxury. The price of poultry products has been increasing by 10% each year for the past ten years; and this is because of the global food and commodity shortages, escalating electricity costs, trade tariffs and stagnant wages, amongst other factors. SA Meat Importers and Exporters call for scrapping chicken tariffs as prices jump: Paul Matthew  ‘Food insecurity’ Meanwhile, Trade economist Donald Mackay believes that the removal of tariffs and VAT will provide immediate relief to consumers. Mackay urges the government to intervene in assisting consumers and to prevent rising food insecurity from escalating into social unrest. South Africa only meets about 80% of the country’s total poultry demand. Certain poultry meat cuts, such as chicken wings and leg quarters, are not produced. Consequently, imports are essential and have become even more critical when South Africa experiences frequent outbreaks of animal-related diseases.
