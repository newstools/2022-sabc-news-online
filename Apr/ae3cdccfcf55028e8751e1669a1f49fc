The Consortium for Refugees and Migrants in South Africa (CoRMSA) has condemned the killing of a Zimbabwean national in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg. Elvis Nyathi was stoned and set alight in a mob attack on Wednesday night. The incident came amid protests by disgruntled residents over alleged murders and robberies in the area. Protestors had accused Nyathi of being in the country illegally. “We are deeply saddened by the occurrences at Diepsloot and CoRMSA would like to convey its condolences to the family of Nyathi. We deeply condemn the murder and we say that the crime cannot be condoned. It is important to note that crime, whether committed by South Africans or foreign nationals, the perpetrators should be brought to book and face the law,” says Advocacy Officer at CoRMSA Muluti Phiri. More than 50 people arrested The South African Police Service (SAPS)  says over 50 people have been arrested so far, following the unrest in the area. Police Minister Bheki Cele and Home Affairs Minister Dr. Aaron Motsoaledi are due to visit the area on Friday morning. Residents are calling on SAPS to be proactive against crime and illegal immigration. SAPS National Spokesperson Athlenda Mathe says a number of people have been arrested for being in the country illegally. “Overnight we have had 28 arrests – two of them on a charge of domestic violence, one for drunken driving, and the rest were arrested for being in the country illegally. You will remember that on Wednesday evening into Thursday morning, those operations saw the arrest of 26 people, and most of those people were arrested for being in the country illegally as well. So, the number of arrests in this area has risen to 54.” A picture gallery of the unrest in Diepsloot:
