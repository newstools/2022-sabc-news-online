The Property Practitioners’ Regulatory Authority (PPRA) is hosting public hearings into racism in the property sector in Kimberley, Northern Cape. The public hearings have already been held in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban where there were shocking revelations about the industry. The PPRA will submit a consolidated report with comments from industry players to the Minister of Human Settlements Mmamoloko Kubayi, following the hearings with the aim of introducing legislative changes that will address racism in the property sector. The hearings follow an incident in which a prospective tenant was discriminated against in Cape Town, because of his race. Executive Manager at the PPRA, Mfundo Daki says, “From the engagement that we had, it occurred to us that indeed this incident did take place and more needed to be done. One of the things that they mentioned is that if you work for a particular agency, say a white agency and you happen to be black, one of the things that the principals would tell them is that they should not go to areas where it’s most affluent and populated by white people.” Daki says discrimination in the property sector is a huge concern. “This is something which is very serious. And these agencies are really insensitive. I mean they are deprived of the ability to earn an income. In affluent areas you know the commission is high, the values of the property are quite high compared to the townships, that’s one of the issues amongst many.” The video below is reporting more on the story:
