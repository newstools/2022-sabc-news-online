The family of the late Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa says it is hoping his murder trial will finally start on April 22. The trial has been postponed yet again in North Gauteng High Court after the lawyer for one of the accused asked for it to stand down to allow them to further prepare for the case. Five men are on trial for allegedly orchestrating the murder of the football star.

We are hoping we will come back to finalise so we can also have closure as a family. We want the matter to be out at rest. We want to live our lives freely and for life to go on at home,” adds Nomalanga Meyiwa. The video below is Tuesday’s court proceeding:
