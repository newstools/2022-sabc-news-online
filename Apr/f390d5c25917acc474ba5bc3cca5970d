The Kwa-Zulu Natal tourism industry which contributes immensely to the province’s GDP has suffered a massive loss due to the floods. The heavy downpours claimed over 400 lives and destroyed businesses, telecoms lines and roads infrastructure. Now, both the provincial and national governments have committed to prioritise budgets to help the severely hit KwaZulu-Natal tourism industry. The North West and the Eastern Cape were also hit hard by floods. Some holiday businesses on the KwaZulu-Natal coastline had to shut their doors temporarily. Tracy-lee Tulloch’s business was severely affected. “We do cleaning for the tourism holiday industry to be specific for the BNB units. When the floods hit us, we could not do anything. All the bookings were cancelled. There was nowhere to get out as there was0 mudslide everywhere,” says Tulloch.
