KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has promised that work to adapt to climate change and mitigate the adverse effects of extreme weather events, like last week’s floods, will be stepped up in the province. This as he assured people at a prayer meeting in Durban, that the province will rebuild after the devastation wreaked by flooding in many parts of KwaZulu-Natal. Zikalala says the work of the KwaZulu-Natal Climate Change Council will be stepped up. “We are also conscious that we still have to do a lot to fight pollution and environmental degradation. We will step up the work of the KwaZulu-Natal Climate Change Council, to ensure that all municipalities are given leadership on what needs to be done to mitigate the effect of climate change,” adds Zikalala. The Premier has thanked volunteers as well as search and rescue teams for working tirelessly to save lives in the wake of the floods in KwaZulu-Natal.
