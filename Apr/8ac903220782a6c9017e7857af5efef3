Humanitarian aid organisation the Gift of the Givers is busy with food preparations in Cape Town on the eve of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The organisation’s logistics centre at Airport Industria is a hive of activity as food supplies are being distributed to facilities such as multi-faith institutions and the needy across the Mother City. Ramadan will be observed from Sunday until Eid-ul-Fitr is announced in a few weeks’ time. Fasting forms one of the pillars of the Muslim faith. Muslims across the world are preparing for Ramadan – the moment the Koran was unveiled to Muhammad, according to Islamic belief. The fasting month starts when the new crescent moon is sited.
