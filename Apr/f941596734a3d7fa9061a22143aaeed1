ANC Treasurer-General Paul Mashatile has called on the more than 700 delegates attending the party’s 13th Mpumalanga Provincial Conference to make sure they elect “tried and tested” individuals, who will take the ANC forward. He says this will be a true reflection of the resolutions of the 54th national elective conference in 2017, which include unity and renewal of the ANC. Latest from the conference with Samkele Maseko:  Mashatile addressed the official opening of the conference in eMalahleni, Mpumalanga this afternoon. “We must seek to its core historical values of unity, values of selflessness and discipline. Values of humility and hard work. Democratic centralism and criticism. Don’t criticise other people if you do not want to be criticised. This comrades is at the heart of our renewal program.” He says the ANC is not only watched by South Africans but also by the rest of the African continent. There have been many challenges and disputes registered by some ANC branches and regions in the province. But Mashatile says this is the time to rectify all the issues. “This conference must be a model of the very best of our movement and the very best of our Cadres. From all of you comrade delegates, we expect maximum discipline. We expect you to engage and debate issues robustly without fear or favour.” ANC’s Paul Mashatile talks to the media ahead of the Mpumalanga Provincial Conference:
