Deputy Judge President Isaac Madondo is on Friday morning expected to be interviewed for the position of Judge President of the KwaZulu-Natal Division of the High Court. He is among the last group of candidates to be interviewed by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) in Sandton. Seven other judge nominees are also expected to be interviewed for three vacancies in the Pietermaritzburg High Court. The JSC interviews are streamed live on SABC News Digital platforms. On Thursday night, the commission concluded the interviews for the Limpopo Division of the High Court by interviewing five candidates. One of the candidates Reuben Nkosi was repeatedly criticised and questioned by commissioners for having listed an additional qualification of an LLD Degree from a University that is not recognised by the US Department of Education. Chief Justice Raymond Zondo also raised concerns. “You seem to be defensive and to be suggesting that maybe commissioners are making a big deal out of nothing. That’s the impression I got. Maybe that’s not what you intended?” Nkosi responded: “I’m surprised. I don’t know how I could have made it clear to whoever was present here. I was taken for a ride, maybe, but I still have to take steps to make sure that my name is not associated with this kind of institution. If I knew I could have remained with the qualifications that I have and remain with the LLM that I have from the University of Pretoria.” Thursday’s Judicial Service Commission interviews:
