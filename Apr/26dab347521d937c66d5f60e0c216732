DJ Black Coffee has won his first Grammy Award, winning the Best Dance/Electronic Album category for his 2021 album titled Subconsciously. The South African music producer, whose real name is Nkosinathi Maphumulo, beat out additional five contenders – including Illenium, Major Lazer, and Ten City – to scoop the category. A first Grammy win for Black Coffee after just his first nomination in a career that has continued to blossom since his first BET Awards won in 2016. He won the Best International Act Category, setting himself on a trajectory to reach this pinnacle moment in his career. He has long expressed his intention to win a Grammy. South African flautist and former Grammy Winner Wouter Kellerman missed out after being nominated in the Best New Age Album category.
