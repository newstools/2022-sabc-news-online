Airports Company South Africa (ACSA) says all operations at King Shaka Airport in Durban are back to normal after flights were delayed on Sunday due to fuel challenges. This is after passengers took to social media to complain about being left stranded at the airport due to delayed flights. ACSA says the delays from King Shaka may have also resulted in delays at OR Tambo Airport. Communications Manager at ACSA, Gopolang Peme says the issue has been resolved and flights schedules are back to normal. “King Shaka International Airport experienced technical issues with the fuel hydro system on Sunday morning, the third of April 2022.  Refuelling had to be done by a tanker, the issue was resolved on the same morning at about 11:30.  During that time, there were six airplanes that experienced delays. However, airport management worked together with staff to bring them back online. All operations are back to normal since then and King Shaka International Airport has sufficient fuel stocks.”
