SACP General-Secretary Dr Blade Nzimande says all peace-loving peoples of the world must use the Russia-Ukraine conflict to call for an end to all conflicts in all parts of the world. He was virtually addressing the media at the end of their Central Committee meeting earlier today. Earlier the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said over 10 million people have now fled their homes in Ukraine due to conflict with an estimated 6,5 million people believed to have been displaced in the war-torn country. Nzimande says in as much as they do not support anyone in the conflict, they believe the US-led NATO must stop leading wars in other parts of the country. “The Central Committee reiterated the SACP call to NATO to stop the conflict in Ukraine with immediate effect and therefore pointing out the facts about principal imperialist agenda and its expansionist aggression does not mean we support any side. In fact, for all peace-loving people in South Africa and the world, we must be using these opportunities to say there must be an end to all wars in all parts of the world because unless we do so we are by default encouraging ongoing destabilisation of regions by the powerful countries.”
