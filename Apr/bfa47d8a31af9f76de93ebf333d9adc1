Delivery drivers sub-contracted with online retail giant Takealot have embarked on protests in Durban and surrounding areas, in KwaZulu-Natal, demanding an increment increase in their pay. At least 600 drivers are said to have downed tools. They are demanding a R5 increment per delivery while they claim that the company is only offering them R1 per delivery. These drivers – who use their own vehicles to deliver goods to customers on behalf of the online retail giant – say due to the high fuel prices they find it hard to make a profit. “We have approached our franchisee owner and our regional manager in KwaZulu-Natal about our request to increase our earnings from R25 for food and R16 for parcels to R5 respectively. But unfortunately, the employer is only offering R1 increase. Over and above the fuel price going up, we are still expected to maintain our cars and buy airtime to contact customers.” Meanwhile, the Durban head office of Takealot has referred queries to its national office.
