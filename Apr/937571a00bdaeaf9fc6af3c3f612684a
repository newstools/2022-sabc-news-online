Residents of Maiden Farm at Mthatha in the Eastern Cape have accused the King Sabatha Dalindyebo Municipality of unfair billing of municipal rates. This, after scores of unemployed residents and grant beneficiaries’ electricity, was disconnected for owing the municipality. Some residents say they’ve occupied government-subsidised houses for more than five years but billing statements were only given to them a year ago. Xoliswa Dywili says electricity in her home was disconnected without warning nor billing statements issued to her, while unemployed 58-year-old Mvuyiso Mathundu has been without electricity for nearly five months because the municipality alleges that he owes R25 000. “They told me I owe them R25 000. I asked them how am I suppose to pay all this money while I’m unemployed. I want to ask them, from their computers, does it say I’m working.” “They told us to pay cause we are on their land. They didn’t tell me they are switching off my electricity, they have not issued any statements or sent anyone to tell me my electricity will be switched off.” King Sabatha Dalindyebo Municipality Spokesperson, Sonwabo Mampoza says the municipality will provide indigent relief and write off outstanding debts for qualifying residents. “After long discussions, it was discovered that some people do have statements which they are querying. The executive mayor in the discussions agreed with the community that those people who claim so will come to the municipal offices with their statements to make sure their matters are addressed.” KSD municipality residents up in arms, accusing municipality of unfair billing:
