The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) says there were no objections against Constitutional Court judge nominee Owen Rogers within the JSC. Chief Justice Raymond Zondo indicated on Wednesday morning that the JSC secretariat received a complaint last night. The complaint reflected that Rogers and nine other judges in the Western Cape High Court Division have a pending complaint laid against them with the Judicial Conduct Committee. Rogers is one of the four candidates recommended by the JSC to be considered by President Cyril Ramaphosa for a vacancy in the ConCourt. JSC Interviews | Judicial Service Commission briefs media on interview process:  Speaking during a media briefing, JSC co-spokesperson Doris Tshepe says, “Just so we clarify that, there’s no JSC process and so we need to be clear because the processes of the JSC cannot involve other members of the JSC who are politicians. That process is still within the JCC and the JCC will deal with that. But just to confirm that there was no objection in respect to Judge Rogers in this matter.” The JSC will continue to interview candidates for various superior courts. There are also two vacancies for the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court and one for the Gauteng Division of the High Court for secondment to the Land Claims Court. On Tuesday night, the JSC recommended four of the five candidates who were interviewed for two vacant positions in the Constitutional Court following deliberations.
