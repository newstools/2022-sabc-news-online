The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has reported 1 768 new COVID-19 cases that have been identified in South Africa, which brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases to 3 737 346.  This increase represents a 7.6% positivity rate. The majority of new cases today are from Gauteng Province (49%), followed by KwaZulu-Natal & Western Cape (19%). The institute says due to the on-going audit exercise by the National Department of Health (NDoH), there may be a backlog of COVID-19 mortality cases reported. “Today, the NDoH reports six deaths, and of these, three occurred in the past 24 – 48 hours. This brings the total fatalities to 100 138 to date,” says the institute in a statement. 24 139 799 tests have been conducted in both public and private sectors.
