Parliament’s Ethics Committee has defended its decision to clear former Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize of any wrongdoing regarding the MPs Code of Conduct over his family involvement in the Digital Vibes tender saga. This follows a complaint by the Democratic Alliance (DA) with the Ethics Committee after the report of Special Investigating Unit found that  Mkhize’s family had benefited from the Digital Vibes tender. “The committee emphasised though that it is basing its findings on the ethics code and that all other investigations by law enforcement agencies will continue to determine if there was or there is any criminal act involved. This is outside the scope of the committee and it is left to law enforcement agencies. The committee assures South Africans that it acts without fear, favour, or prejudice on all matters brought before it,” says Co-chairperson of the Ethics Committee Bhekizwe Nkosi.

DA MP Siviwe Gwarube had initiated the complaint against Mkhize. “Our view is that this application of the code is so narrow that it misses the spirit of the ethics code and what the ethics code seeks to do. Ultimately, if we are going to have an ethics code, it is very important that it is applied broadly and as generously as possible, so that it can really prevent what it seeks to prevent.”
