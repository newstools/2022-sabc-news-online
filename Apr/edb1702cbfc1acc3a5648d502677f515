The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee member, Ronald Lamola has appealed for peace as the party gears up to hold its Limpopo provincial conference in June. Current provincial chairperson, Stanley Mathabatha, who’s gunning for a third term, is set to lock horns with party giant in the province, Dickson Masemola. Talking during the OR Tambo Memorial Lecture in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, Lamola says Oliver Tambo dedicated his life to the unity of the African National Congress. He urges party members to unite as a way to honour the spirit of Tambo. Lamola says infighting and factional battles within the party don’t represent what Tambo stood for.  He argues that contestations during party congresses should be robust but should not be characterised by battles and chairs flying “because during Tambo time, debates were robust but unity was maintained.” Lamola calls for peace ahead of Limpopo ANC conference:  ‘Generational mix’ Meanwhile, Lamola has neither denied nor confirmed rumours that he will be contesting for the party’s national deputy chairmanship in December this year. He is non-committal about his ambition to contest a position in the top five of the party. Lamola says, however, that the party’s leadership needs a generational mix. “The ANC in all its structures it does need generational mix it does need a youthful organisation to infuse energy and also to infuse a new direction that is also what the generation of Tambo did they came from the youth league the generation of Mandela and many generations of youth leaguers that is what must also happen in the national conference there must be generational mix the ANC to remain relevant must infuse young people.” The party will have a national conference to elect the new leadership in December this year. Lamola has also urged members to report corruption happening in their areas. -Reporting by Lutendo Bobodi O.R. Tambo memorial lecture delivered by Justice Minister Ronald Lamola:
