Political analyst Levy Ndou says although former Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has resigned from the post, his implication in the State Capture report will cast aspersions on his character. Part four of the State Capture report which was officially handed over to the Presidency earlier today, detailed how Mkhize received over R6-million from businessman Edwin Sodi. In his testimony before the Commission, Sodi said the payments were for the ANC. However, the Commission asked why the name of the ANC was not the one recorded. Meanwhile, Mkhize is said to be gunning for ANC Presidency in the party’s elective conference at the end of the year. Ndou says the report will not stand him in good stead as he makes this pursuit. “Dr Mkhize has resigned as a Minister of Health because of the allegations levelled against him by the SIU. If we still hear his name coming out from the Zondo Commission, it actually puts him in a very, very difficult situation especially when he has got the ambition to occupy a top position within the ANC which has the potential to guarantee him a position in government. This puts a huge cloud over his head because it would mean that Zweli Mkhize cannot be trusted when it comes to public resources,” says Ndou.
