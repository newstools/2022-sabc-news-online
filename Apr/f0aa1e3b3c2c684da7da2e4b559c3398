The Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court in Johannesburg has granted the defence lawyer in the Senzo Meyiwa murder case bail of R10 000. Advocate Malesela Teffo will be back in the same court on May 27. He was arrested on Thursday, following proceedings in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. Advocate Teffo allegedly failed to appear in a trespassing matter. It is alleged that a warrant of arrest was issued in January this year. Advocate Teffo is representing four of the accused in the Senzo Meyiwa trial. This is how the magistrate read out the order. “In light of the fact that this is the second time that the accused has not appeared in this court and this is the second time that a warrant of arrest was authorised, issued and executed against the accused, I am of the view that an amount of R10 000 is suitable, reasonable and justified. The bail amount is accordingly then ordered by this court to stand at R10 000.” The video below, is the court proceedings:  Meanwhile, National Police Commissioner, Fannie Masemola, has asked Gauteng Police Commissioner, Elias Mawela, to submit a report on the arrest of Teffo.
