Free State MEC for Police, Roads and Transport William Bulwane says he has decided to close the R30 between Allanridge and Bothaville until there is a permanent solution. Bulwane’s decision comes after six more people were killed on the road on Saturday. More details about the accident in the Facebook post below: This brings to 23 the number of people who have died on the R30 since the beginning of the year. The waterlogged road has become a nightmare for motorists while the challenge is compounded by persistent downpours. Bulwane’s decision is also informed by an alleged discovery that the water overflow is exacerbated by a burst pipe from a nearby mine. He will meet with Harmony mine management and the leadership from Matjhabeng Local Municipality. “I have instructed the department to close that road. By the end of today, that road will be completely closed until we do something about it because it is now becoming a killer road for us in the province.” Meanwhile, Harmony Mine in the Free State has denied claims that some of its water pipelines are causing waterlog on the road. Harmony Mine spokesperson Sihle Maake says: “Harmony has no water pipeline within the R30 road and the operation in question is approximately six kilometres from where the affected road is. The municipality has also used the waste rock or gravel to basically build the ramp on the R30 which has basically divided the flood area into two separate ponds on either side of the road. We don’t have contributions to this whatsoever.” -Report by Kamogelo Seekoei
