A man and a woman have been arrested in separate incidents in Cape Town for the illegal possession of ammunition and drugs, respectively.

He says members of the Provincial Extortion Task Team arrested a 56-year-old man for the illegal possession of ammunition in Mfuleni, while a 36- year-old woman was arrested in Eersteriver for illegal possession of mandrax, when officers executed a warrant. Members of the police received information about a firearm and ammunition at an identified premises and searched it. While searching the premises the members found 21 x 7.65 rounds of ammunition in a safe. When asked if the man had a licence to possess ammunition, he could not produce one.
