Power utility Eskom says the implementation of Stage 2 loadshedding will be extended to Wednesday evening and Thursday night respectively. This will be from 5pm until 5am on both nights and will be suspended at 5am on Friday.  #POWERALERT2 Stage 2 loadshedding will be extended to Wednesday and Thursday nights from 17:00 until 05:00 on Friday due to shortage of generation capacity and continued delays to the return to service

Mantshantsha says: “Eskom teams are working hard to return as many of these units to service as possible. A single unit that had tripped at Lethabo Power Station this morning has returned to service this evening. This unit, however, will take some time to reach full production. Eskom would like to inform the public that any further deterioration in generation capacity may require further loadshedding. We currently have 4 804 MW on planned maintenance.”
