Eight workers have been placed on suspension for alleged corruption and maladministration in the Mogalakwena municipality in Mokopane, Limpopo. The municipality is acting on the Special Investigating Unit report which recommended the suspension and that the matter be taken for prosecution. The workers will be suspended for three months pending investigations. The municipality has incurred unauthorised expenditure of nearly R3 billion between 2015 and 2019. Municipal Spokesperson Malesela Selokela says disciplinary actions will be instituted. “The eight municipal officials were yesterday served suspension letters sent by the Acting Municipal Manager Mr Hendrick Ngoepe. All municipal officials are suspended for three months with full pay,” says Sekolela. Last week, community structures, including the South African National Civic Organisation (Sanco) and Mogalakwena Concerned and Affected Communities embarked on a series of protests against corruption and financial mismanagement at the municipality two years ago. “We are saying that would be a good job if whatever they are suspended for is found to be correct. We have been saying for a long time, we applaud whoever is doing the investigation and found that we were correct. We let the law takes its course,” says Mogalakwena Concerned and Affected Communities’ Spokesperson, Motlatso Selomo.
