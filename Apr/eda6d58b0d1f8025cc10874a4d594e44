Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters are picketing at two separate farms that billionaire businessman, Johann Rupert owns in Stellenbosch outside Cape Town and the Leopard Creek in Malalane, Mpumalanga. The party says the purpose of the picket is to demand back land which it says was dispossessed from black South Africans by “colonial settlers”. The EFF claims Rupert is a beneficiary of land dispossession that occurred on this day in 1652. EFF National Spokesperson Sinawo Tambo says the march is also aimed at putting a spotlight on challenges that farmworkers are facing:  Meanwhile, EFF Mpumalanga leader, Collen Sedibe, says Deputy President Floyd Shivambu will lead the provincial leg of the picket. “Today, the EFF will be picketing outside the Rupert Farm in Leopard Creek in Malalane as part of our land day programme. We resemble the days when the Boer arrived in 1652 and forcefully took our land from our forefathers. As EFF, we will gather there to picket. The picket will be led by deputy president, Floyd Shivambu  at Malalane Leopard Creek.”
