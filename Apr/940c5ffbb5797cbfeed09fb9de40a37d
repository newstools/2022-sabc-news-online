The United Democratic Movement (UDM) has written to President Cyril Ramaphosa requesting that he consider forming a multi-party committee to help restore peace to townships and protect the country’s sovereignty. This follows recent tensions in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg, where violent clashes between foreign nationals and locals have led to a spate of killings. UDM leader Bantu Holomisa says, “The people in the township and rural areas have been neglected. The state has failed completely. When you discuss the issue of immigration and so on, we need to sit down and look at which role must be played in this instance?

Cele has promised to reinforce police resources in the area by providing more police vehicles and deploying top detectives to deal with rampant crime in the area.
