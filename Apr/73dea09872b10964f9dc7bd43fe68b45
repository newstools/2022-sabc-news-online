There are mixed reactions to the appointment of former Lesedi FM Current Affairs anchor Palesa Chubisi as Free State Premier Sisi Ntombela’s spokesperson. The Free State Publishers and Editors Forum has welcomed Chubisi’s appointment, saying the communication machinery in Ntombela’s office has been weakened in the last four years. Forum chairperson Lebona Lekoenea says Chubisi’s appointment will sharpen the communication department in the office of the premier. “This appointment is made at the right time, where the relationship between government and media in the province has suffered immensely. This appointment is indeed in line with the forum’s long-standing call that the premier should strengthen the communications department within her office.” However, the African National Congress Youth’s Congress Preparatory Committee in the Free State has questioned Chubisi’s appointment, arguing that the position requires individuals who are politically and ideologically grounded in ANC policies. The league’s spokesperson Phiwe Mathe says Ntombela’s decision will weaken the ANC and demoralise its cadreship. “What should be clarified from the onset is that we are not against Palesa Chubisi being employed in the provincial government. But we do not support her appointment into that specific role as we believe such a role requires cadres who are politically and ideologically grounded in ANC policies, principles and values.”
