Eskom has announced that any further deterioration in generation capacity may result in further power cuts. This follows the power utility’s decision to continue Stage 2 rolling blackouts until 5 o’clock on Friday morning.  The power utility Eskom says the implementation of Stage 2 blackouts will be extended to Wednesday and Thursday  from 5pm until 5am on both nights and will be suspended at 5am on Friday.   Eskom says the extension is due to the failure of additional units as well as the continued delays in returning to service of other generating units. “The extension of loadshedding is caused by the failure of additional units and the continued shortage of generation capacity due to delays in returning to service three generating units at Camden Power Station and two generating units at Tutuka Power Station. Overnight a generation unit each at Medupi, Matla, Kendal and Komati power stations failed while 240MW of power imports from Mozambique was interrupted, exacerbating the supply constraints. Three generation units were returned to service at Matla, Grootvlei and Camden,” Eskom’s Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha explains.
