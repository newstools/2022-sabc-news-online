The axed 130 employees of the City of Johannesburg have welcomed the Labour court’s decision regarding their case. The court has granted an interdict preventing the City from terminating contracts of the employees pending an outcome from the bargaining council. The court has also ordered the City to reverse a directive to change the staffers terms of employment from permanent back to fixed term. The directive which was issued in March meant the workers employment contracts would expire come the end of April. Spokesperson for the group, Rich Hlatswayo says “We welcome the judgement as it vindicates our long standing position that our employment at the City of Joburg was effected within the prescription was within the prescription of the SA constitution and labour laws. We are pleased that the court has ruled in our favour and justice has finally prevailed.”   City of Joburg Mayor Mpho Phalatse confirms reversal of over 100 permanent employees [March 2022] Johannesburg Mayor Mpho Phalatse confirmed the reversal of the appointment of permanent employees in March 2022.
