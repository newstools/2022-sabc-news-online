The Jacob Zuma Foundation has confirmed that the former President will be present at the Pietermaritzburg High Court on Monday for the resumption of his corruption trial. It follows the recent dismissal by the Supreme Court of Appeal of Zuma’s leave to appeal his corruption prosecution, including his attempt to remove State Advocate, Billy Downer, from the trial. Zuma and French arms company, Thales, face charges including corruption, racketeering, fraud and money laundering linked to a multi-billion rand arms deal. The Foundation’s Spokesperson Mzwanele Manyi says, “The foundation confirms that Zuma, contrary to speculations, will be at the PMB Court tomorrow, the 11th of April, he is going to be there. Zuma, through his legal team, will be responding to the supplementary affidavit served by the NPA where they seek to introduce new evidence on the events of the last few days.” BREAKING:
