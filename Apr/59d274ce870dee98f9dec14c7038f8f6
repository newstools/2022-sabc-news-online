The eThekwini Municipality says it fears that the number of visitors over the Easter weekend is likely to drop, as many areas affected by the floods in the province are still without water and electricity. The manufacturing and tourism sectors are believed to be among the sectors that have been severely impacted by the natural disaster. In a statement, the municipality says despite the challenges, the City remains open for business. Each year, during this Easter period, the City experiences an influx of visitors who travel to Durban for the sunny skies and blue beaches. But with the recent heavy rains that wreaked havoc across the province, expectations are that several tourists may have decided to cancel or postpone holiday plans. The South African Weather Service has also advised that rains are likely to return this weekend. KZN Floods I Holidaymakers share their thoughts on the Durban Beach Front
