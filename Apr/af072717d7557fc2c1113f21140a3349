The late Acting Director-General in the Gauteng Office of the Premier, Thabo Masebe, has been described as an authentic communicator when dealing with the media. On Friday, SANEF and Government Communications held his memorial service in Pretoria.  Masebe passed away on Monday this week. He was 58 years-old. He cut his teeth as a government communicator in former Gauteng Premier Mbhazima Shilowa’s office from 1999 until 2008. He also served as a spokesperson for former President Kgalema Motlanthe. Masebe was the Acting Director -General in the office of the current Gauteng Premier David Makhura at the time of his passing. Family spokesperson Phophi Ramathuba says they will always appreciate his honesty. “Thabo is not a praise singer, if he says to you, you have done well, I know I have done well. Some of the people want to buy my face, but with Thabo, he was genuine. And as a politician, I’m saying I was fortunate to have him in my life to say I’ve got a person who’s objective,” says Ramathuba. News of Masebe’s passing:
