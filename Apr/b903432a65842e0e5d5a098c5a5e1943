The South African Police Service (SAPS) says over 50 people have been arrested so far following the unrest in Diepsloot, north of Johannesburg. Police Minister Bheki Cele and Home Affairs Minister Dr Aaron Motsoaledi are due to visit the area on Friday morning. Residents are calling on the police to be pro-active against crime and illegal immigration. SAPS National Spokesperson Athlenda Mathe says a number of people have been arrested for being in the country illegally. “Overnight we have had 28 arrests – two of them on a charge of domestic violence, one for drunken driving and the rest were arrested for being in the country illegally. You will remember that on Wednesday evening into Thursday morning, those operations saw the arrest of 26 people and most of those people were arrested for being in the country illegally as well. So the number of arrests in this area has risen to 54.” Earlier in the week, Police Minister Bheki Cele, new National Police Commissioner Fannie Masemola, Gauteng MEC for Community Safety Faith Mazibuko and Gauteng Premier David Makhura all visited the area to find out first-hand what the residents are protesting about. The killing of Zimbabwean national, Elvis Nyati, on Wednesday night allegedly by a mob has raised SAPS attention in the area. Latest reports suggest that the mood is calm but volatile in Diepsloot.
