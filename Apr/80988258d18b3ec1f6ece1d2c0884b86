Northern Cape Police are investigating a case of assault and rape against a Kimberley-based traditional healer. It is alleged that the man assaulted and raped his initiates over a period of time. The family of one initiate who was allegedly assaulted by the healer wants the law to take its course. What was meant to be a sacred ritual of initiation turned into three months of agony. The victim’s mother says her daughter experienced the worst form of abuse at the hands of a Sangoma who was meant to initiate her. The mother explains, “It was as bad as she couldn’t even stand straight on her own. They didn’t just beat them. They used abusive words toward them. Even if you are you are a strong person, those words will also make you think twice.” It is alleged that the traditional healer also raped another initiate. They both had to flee for their safety. “Gobela must pay, justice must take place and he must pay for his own doings to the kids. It’s painful. You put your trust in someone and that person just shatters everything” adds the mother. Traditional healer and member of the Traditional Healers Organisation Mkhulu Dungumanzi has come out against him. “I am very ashamed of what you paint. I’m very ashamed because that thing is giving us traditional healers a bad name.” The sangoma who is in his twenties was arrested and later released. Police say the matter is now before the National Prosecuting Authority for further instructions.  -Reporting by Neria Hlakotsa
