The African National Congress Special National Executive Committee (ANC NEC) has disbanded the Women’s League NEC. The disbandment comes after recommendations from the party’s Task Team led by Thandi Modise and Nathi Mthethwa. After weeks of speculation on the future of the league, the Special NEC has finally taken a decision, ultimately sealing the fate of the structure elected in 2015. The main reason for the disbandment of the Women’s League NEC is that the structure has been in office since 2015 and its five year term of office had expired. The ANC NEC met during a special session over the weekend. The NEC meeting was held in preparation for the party’s National Policy Conference to be held at the end of July and the National Elective Conference in December 2022.
