The KwaZulu-Natal Co-operative Governance Department has urged residents in low-lying areas to seek shelter on higher grounds. Heavy rains are continuing in areas across the province. At this stage, authorities are unable to confirm how many people have died. Department spokesperson Senzwelwe Mzila says disaster management teams are on the ground to assess the extent of the damage. “So far the extent of the heavy rains is across the province with eThekwini being one of the most affected areas. Disaster management teams have been evacuating people in areas that have experienced mudslides, flooding, and structural collapses of buildings and roads. The heavy rains have affected power lines in many municipalities with technical teams working around the clock to restore power. Residents in areas that are on higher ground are urged to open up their homes for their neighbours who are stranded as a result of the flooding caused by the heavy rains. Many roads are blocked and residents are requested to avoid unnecessary journeys,” says Mzila. VIDEO: KwaZulu-Natal Storm I Heavy rains continue to wreak havoc
