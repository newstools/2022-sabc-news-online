South Africa have beaten Bangladesh by 220 runs in the first cricket test at Kingsmead in Durban. Bangladesh were bowled out for just 53 runs in their second innings, the lowest total in a test match in Durban. Keshav Maharaj was named player of the match after taking seven wickets for 32 runs in 10 overs in Bangladesh’s second innings. It will be a memorable victory for the South Africans, who are missing five first team regulars that have opted to play in the Indian Premier League, including their entire frontline pace attack. South Africa’s lack of bowling options had in part forced them to play two spinners at a venue that has traditionally been known to favour the seamers. Maharaj’s effort was all the more impressive after he bowled with a finger injury on the fourth and fifth days, but the guile and accuracy with which he and Harmer attacked the Bangladeshis was impressively relentless. Maharaj trapped Mushfiqur Rahim (0) leg before wicket in the opening over of the day and from then on it was a procession of batsmen back to the pavilion. He had the dangerous Litton Das (2) caught by Harmer at mid-on, and then bowler Yasir Ali (5) with a delivery that pitched on middle stump and hit off. Harmer removed Mehidy Hasan Miraz (0) and innings top-scorer Najmul Hossain Shanto (26), the latter stumped by wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne, before Maharaj claimed the final two wickets. The second test match will be played in Gqeberha and starts on Thursday. Additional reporting by Reuters
