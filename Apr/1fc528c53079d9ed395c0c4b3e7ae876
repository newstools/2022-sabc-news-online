Limpopo Transport authorities say there will be high visibility of law enforcers on the roads as they brace for traffic volumes during the Easter long weekend. MEC Mavhungu Lerule-Ramakhanya has warned motorists not to speed and that they will also conduct roadworthiness tests on vehicles on the roadside. Traffic authorities had manned a roadblock on the N1 north at Kranskop toll plaza. Lerule-Ramakhanya says the law enforcers will deal with the transgressing motorists. “What we have done now is to emphasise on the visibility of our team police, both the traffic and police – SAPS – and our teams. Wherever we are putting up a road-block in our operation, we are going to bring in the mobile testing roadworthiness machine that we are able to test cars on the spot. We are going to be manning the road with cameras so that we use cameras to check the speed.” A minibus taxi operator whose vehicle was impounded for allegedly operating without a permit, Freedom Mathabatha, says he was forced to operate illegally as it is difficult to get a permit from the Transport Department. “I feel it’s a very, very bad problem. So, I have lost everything that I worked for today. We don’t get a permit from the department. We must buy it from someone and then buy it, from someone else to cost more than R150 000. So, we don’t have that money we want the cars.” Easter Holiday | Motorists driving unroadworthy vehicles slapped with traffic fines:
