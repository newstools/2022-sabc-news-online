The United States Senate made history in confirming the first woman black justice to the country’s Supreme Court. Three Republican Senators joined all Democrats to give those in favour of Ketanji Brown-Jackson’s appointment a 53 to 47 majority, with all remaining GOP senators voting no. The vote draws to a close the process to confirm the 51-year-old who will replace Justice Stephen Breyer who is due to step down at the end of the court’s summer session. The vote went as expected with Republicans Lisa Murkowski, Mitt Romney and Susan Collins joining the Democratic majority to confirm the 116th Justice of the country’s highest court. Brown-Jackson becomes the first black woman justice in the court’s 233-year history and only the fifth woman. In the video below, United States Congressman John Leboutillier sheds light on Judge Ketanji Brown-Jackson’s experience as a public defender: Her successful confirmation is seen as a victory for President Joe Biden who had promised to name a black woman to the court when he ran for office in 2020. He said Brown-Jackson would bring extraordinary qualifications, deep experience, intellect, and a rigorous judicial record to the Supreme Court.
