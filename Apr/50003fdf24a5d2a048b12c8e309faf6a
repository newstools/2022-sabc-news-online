South African Communist Party (SACP) leader Blade Nzimande says the SACP, Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the African National Congress (ANC) must use their upcoming national conferences to place the interest of the poor and workers of South Africa first. He says the biggest enemy of the revolution today is corruption. Nzimande was delivering a keynote address in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg at the 29th Anniversary commemoration of the death of Chris Hani. The SACP leader was assassinated outside his Dawn Park home in Boksburg in 1993. Nzimande pleaded with the alliance partners not to use their conferences to create divisions and factions within the alliance. “You get a strategy of people working to capture certain structures of the organisation so that they can go and capture municipal budgets and distribute patronage and enrich themselves. We must have no tolerance for that. Let’s use our conferences to reflect on what happened in local government elections last year and reflect honestly and correct what needs to be corrected. There is no revolution that does not make mistakes,” says Nzimande. 29th Annual commemoration of the death of Chris Hani – Jeff Radebe address
