At least 58 hospitals including clinics have been severely damaged by floods in KwaZulu-Natal. Provincial Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane says a number of health facilities suffered various damage from flooding to roofs being blown off. “With the damage that has been done by these floods in our different facilities when you look at uGu as a district, we have more than 15 facilities that have been affected. The roofs … some of the roofs have been pulled off the facilities. In other areas there is damage that would really need a lot of money to actually rebuild. When you go to eThekwini even there you find that just above 20 facilities were damaged by the storm; you go to iLembe district, even there the number is quite high. We are just quoting the coastal facilities because that is where the severity of the storm.” Meanwhile, more than 390 people have lost their lives in the province so far with more rain expected over the weekend. Thousands more have been displaced after their homes were washed away by torrential downpours. The Department of Human Settlements says around 4 000 homes have been completely destroyed by the floods in KZN, with Tshelimnyama having been one of the areas most affected.
