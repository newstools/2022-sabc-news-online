The Dispute Resolution Chamber of the National Soccer League has dismissed Cheslyn Jampies’ case against his former club, Baroka football club. Jampies accused Baroka of unfairly terminating his contract. His contract, which was due to end next year, was terminated last year for misconduct due to him being absent from work for three days without permission. Jampies is now playing for Sekhukhune United football club. The resolution chamber dismissed the case with costs.
