EFF leader Julius Malema says he’s unfazed by criticisms from ‘Operation Dudula’ members. He says he stands by his principles and will never entertain those who want to gain popularity using his name. ‘Operation Dudula’ accused Malema of supporting the presence of illegal foreign nationals in South Africa. Malema says the operation has a long way to go. “They are new in what they are doing. If you listen when they speak, they all imitate me. There is no principle to engage them. I’m dealing here with principle.” Nhlanhla ‘Lux’ Mohlauli, leader of ‘Operation Dudula’,  faces charges of housebreaking, theft, and malicious damage to property after members allegedly raided the house of an elderly man in Soweto that locals had alleged was being used to sell drugs.
