A member of the SAPS search and rescue team has died at the Henley Dam near Pietermaritzburg in KwaZulu-Natal. Forty-two-year old Sergeant Busisiswe Mjwara drowned while searching for flood victims at the dam, after their car was washed away. Police dog, Leah from the Durban SAPS K9, also drowned. This has been revealed by KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala during a media briefing in Durban this afternoon. “We wish to convey our heartfelt condolences and sympathy to the people and the family of one of our search and rescue team member, who was busy doing search and rescue at Helen Dam. He experienced difficulty breathing and was airlifted to the Mediclinic hospital and unfortunately he passed away.”  Meanwhile, families of people, who were washed away by floods in Durban, have called on the government to bring more members of search and rescue teams. This follows heavy rains, which claimed lives of 443 people in KwaZulu-Natal. Sixty three people are still missing. Search and Rescue teams from other provinces have been roped in to assist. The family of 53-year-old Msawakhe Dlamini who was washed away by floods at Ndlanzi north of Durban, says they want search and rescue teams to come and search for his body. The bodies of eight people have been found in ward 43 in Lindelani alone, while four other people are still missing. Ntokozo Dlamini says his uncle was washed away by floods while he was trying to cross over to a nearby house. “He was crossing over and the heavy current of water blew him away but the issue here is that the person has not been found and we need assistance, a rescue team to come and help us.” The floods have killed 443 people while thousands of people have been left displaced. The government declared a provincial state of disaster in KwaZulu-Natal.
