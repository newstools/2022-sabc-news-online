Mamelodi Sundowns co-coach, Rhulani Mokwena, says his team needs stronger rivals to improve football in the country. The Brazilians clinched their fifth straight league title last night with four games to spare this season. Sundowns have now won twelve league titles in the PSL era, and look set to dominate the local scene for years to come. They are still in contention to complete a treble this season, after winning their first MTN-8 title in many years, earlier this season. Mokwena says their aim now is to surpass the 67-point mark they managed last season when they clinched their fourth league title. “The reality is for the betterment of South African football for sure, we need stronger rivals and that’s hundred percent correct. Bbut whether or not that is something I have thought about? No, because fortunately it’s not my responsibility. Fortunately, it is a difficult thing to try and compete with Sundowns one hundred percent, a good sparring partner always helps the champion,” says Mokwena.
