The Cape Town Disaster Risk Management Centre says it has requested that the provincial Human Settlements Department assist in the rebuilding of homes for residents of the Joe Slovo informal settlement in Langa. It follows a fire that destroyed around 300 dwellings on the Cape Flats at the weekend, leaving 1 200 people homeless. “Our concern now is to get the community back on their feet and start rebuilding, but that matter will be addressed at a later stage. From a disaster management perspective, we have made an application to the leadership. So talks are under way with Human Settlements and hopefully we will be able to support the community in terms of providing starter kits to rebuild,” says Charlotte Powell, Disaster Risk Management spokesperson. The scene remains tense as residents are starting to rebuild. Please keep all those affected in your prayers at this difficult time. The city will continue to support the community to the best of our ability. pic.twitter.com/omXBwl5jDk — Dr Zahid Badroodien (@ZahidBadroodien) April 17, 2022  Fire at Langa informal settlement leaves over 1 200 displaced:
