Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula has warned motorists against disobeying the law over the Easter long weekend. Mbalula, Ministers of Water & Sanitation Senzo Mchunu, Human Settlements Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane were visiting areas affected by floods across KwaZulu-Natal, to assess the damage. Search and rescue operations are expected to continue. At least 395 people have lost their lives and thousands others displaced following torrential rains and floods that washed away their homes. This, as the South Africa Weather Service has forecast more rain in KwaZulu-Natal over this Easter Weekend. Mbalula says his department is working hand in hand with SANRAL to assist motorists affected by floods. “Sanral has initiated designated a 24-hour call center that will be addressing public inquiries on road conditions as well as traffic updates, especially during Easter weekend and those numbers will be provided that can be contacted. Sanral and some engineers have cleaned the roads that were closed due to mudslides and debris.” LIVE BEYOND EASTER WEEKEND: A CALL FOR RESPONSIBLE ROAD USE We are cognisant that this is going to be one of the most challenging Easter weekends as we expected increased volumes of traffic. We will increase law enforcement and we call for responsible driving. #LiveBeyondEaster pic.twitter.com/aGv0bWvgO7 — FIKILE MBALULA | MR FIX (@MbalulaFikile) April 13, 2022  The National Department of Transport through the PRMG will support the province over the period of 3 years to address the current disaster it is facing with added financial resources.
