Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)  leader Julius Malema has arrived in Stellenbosch in Cape Town to lead a protest march to Remgro Offices belonging to tobacco and luxury goods magnate, Johann Rupert. The party alleges that Rupert is a major beneficiary of the land which was dispossessed from Africans by his forefathers when they arrived on the South African shores on this day, 6 April 1652. “The land of our people was stolen and until this day we feel the effects, people live in squalor, they are unemployed, they are underdeveloped and designed to be a service of a white minority that established that blueprint of the servitude of Africa in 1652. So, we are here today on the 6th  of April  2022 to confront one of the greatest benefactors of that dispossession of the land Johann Rupert who is an oligarch here in South Africa,” says EFF Spokesperson, Sinawo Tambo. There is high police presence at the Western Cape march:  Members of the party are also marching in Mpumalanga. EFF Deputy President Floyd Shivambu is leading the Mpumalanga leg of the march to the farm as part of the march. Residents of Malalane in Mpumalanga have accused the management of Riverside farm of violating their rights. The residents claim, the management of the farm which is owned by billionaire Johan Rupert Family has desecrated the graves of their loved ones. Chairperson of the Riverside graves beneficiaries committee Samuel Lukhele says they cannot even perform the necessary rituals for their departed loved ones.
