United Nations (UN) Secretary-General(SG) , Antonio Guterres, has welcomed the efforts of Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta and the East African community to promote peace, stability and development in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Leaders of Kenya, Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda met in a conclave late last week, pledging to back Kinshasa’s bid to bring stability within its borders. They resolved to create a two-track approach: establish a joint force to combat armed groups in addition to resolving to invite regional leaders, the African Union and the UN to support the initiative.

Guterres urged local armed groups in the DRC to participate unconditionally in the political process and all foreign armed groups, particularly in the country’s volatile East, to disarm and return unconditionally and immediately to their respective countries of origin.
