Residents of Isipingo Hills, south of Durban, are living in fear after some community members allegedly hijacked a water tanker in the area. It is alleged that residents with firearms stopped a water tanker and filled their own tanks on Saturday before instructing the driver to deliver water to another part of the area. Some parts of Isipingo are still without water since the floods almost two weeks ago. Chairperson of the Isipingo Community Policing Forum, Aidan David, says residents are frustrated because there are not enough water tankers to service their areas. “The residents are now getting a bit frustrated and they are getting impatient because we believe that Ethekwini was having water problems and shortages from now. So there should have been some contingency plans being put in place which hasn’t been done and it’s frustrating the community. There’s been a shortage of water tankers. Not every ward has been catered for the water tankers. Why that is so, I don’t know. The minimum water tankers that are around, like 5 water tankers to 50 000 people, it is very difficult to handle,” says David. VIDEO: KZN Floods I Water shortage after floods in KZN
