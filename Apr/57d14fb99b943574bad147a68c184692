The Democratic Alliance (DA) has slammed the ANC government as being what the DA says is ‘inhumane treatment of people’ following leader John Steenhuisen oversight visit to check on the situation of foreign nationals when it comes to the Home Affairs offices in Newtown, Johannesburg. Steenhuisen’s visit takes place following several violent incidents targeting foreign nationals that have taken place in recent weeks across the country. The DA believes that foreign nationals are being scapegoated and that it is the ANC government’s inability to root out corruption and incompetence at Home Affairs that is destroying the rule of law in South Africa. Steenhuisen says, “If we can’t even provide these services to our citizens it’s little wonder that we are now sitting with this huge problem of undocumented migration in South Africa. Because even people who want to get the correct documentation are facing this monumental wall of corruption, maladministration and complete inhumane treatment of people and that is the thing that has made me most sad talking to people today. And obviously, it’s not good enough. So, I want to find out from inside what are the delays, why are we sitting with queues and what on earth needs to be done on their side to improve the situation.” Meanwhile, Operation Dudula is calling on the relevant authorities to take action against illegal immigrants. The group’s Treasurer General Dan Radebe says Operation Dudula will not take action against people believed to be illegal immigrants such as in the recent events in Diepsloot, Johannesburg. “On all our launches, we never confronted anybody and asked them for the IDs or passports or whatever because we are doing our march peacefully. We have got nothing to do with Diepsloot because people there stated on the media that Operation Dudula was present there,” says Radebe. Foreign nationals concerned about Operation Dudula moving to Kwazulu Natal
