About 20 people have died in Mpumalanga due to road crashes since the beginning of the Easter holidays. Safety Security and Liaison Spokesperson, Moeti Mmusi says negligent driving appears to be a major cause of the fatal crashes. Mmusi says law enforcement officers have been deployed on various roads as the traffic volumes are expected to increase on Monday. “There has been a significant law enforcement visibility, which we believe has assisted us in terms of clamping down negligent driving while other motorists have complied with the rules. Although our numbers indicate so far that we are nearing 20 fatalities between the 14th and the 17th, we hope that once the minister releases the statistics we would have performed as we would have wanted to in terms of the fatalities and the fatal crashes,” says Mmusi.

Mpumalanga Police Commissioner Semakaleng Manamela says they also arrested one suspect for being in possession of firearm. “The successes are huge and you still remember that last week we recovered two firearms from a vehicle that was from Mozambique to South Africa. We also effected one arrest and the vehicle that was recovered as such,” says Manamela. Tollgates are now busy as holidaymakers return to industrial hubs.
