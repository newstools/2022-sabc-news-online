Cogta Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has urged communities across the country to exercise caution as heavy rains continue to leave a trail of destruction in parts of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). At least 59 people have been reported to have died as a result of flooding which started over the weekend caused by torrential rains. Dlamini-Zuma issued a list of precautionary measures for KwaZulu-Natal residents to take. Disaster Management teams are continuing to work around the clock to assist residents that have been trapped as a result of the inclement weather conditions which led to localised flooding of human settlements and roads across the province. pic.twitter.com/CyPoezsdKh — KZNCOGTA (@kzncogta) April 12, 2022 Many have been left destitute as their homes have been destroyed by the flooding. The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) has, consequently, warned those in low-lying areas to evacuate to safer places. Meanwhile, provincial and local disaster teams across the country are providing support to those affected. This, while the South African Weather Services has issued a warning for more rains still expected in many parts of the country. Meanwhile the Department of Transport in the province has also asked motorists to be extra vigilant in the roads as the flash floods continues to batter the province, resulting in overflowing rivers, submerged vehicles, and destroyed properties.
