The South African Communist Party (SACP) first deputy secretary Solly Mapaila has criticised Eskom Board member Busisiwe Mavuso for her comments in which she blamed the ANC-led government for what she referred to as the mess that Eskom had found itself in. Mavuso made the remarks during a SCOPA oversight visit on Friday last week. Mapaila says the comments are shocking. “That announcement was shocking to us and completely unacceptable. In fact, it showed some people when they are deployed on the basis of their professional capacity they just don’t know what to do. Their task and the task of this current Board is to turn around Eskom to deal with state capture, to address problems of corruption but to make the institution efficient and if there is a lack of policies to come back to the party and parliament and so that they can create new policies to govern that institution but at the moment all those are in place they must just do their job,” says Mapaila.
