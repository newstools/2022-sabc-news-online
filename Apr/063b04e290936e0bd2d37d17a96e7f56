Police have arrested the defence lawyer in the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial at the High Court in Pretoria. Advocate Malesela Teffo was arrested shortly after the court adjourned on Thursday afternoon. Details on his arrest are still sketchy,  but instructing attorney Thabiso Thobane earlier told the court they have been receiving intimidating calls since Monday. Teffo represents four of the accused in the matter. Thabane says, “Can you imagine while you’re at home someone calls you and asks if you know a particular acting judge, then if you ask why you are asking me that question,then he drops the phone, the next thing he calls again then I can hear paperwork on the take. In one day I received five calls, during lunch we received a tip that they want to arrest my advocate. Those are intimidation tactics.” Senzo Meyiwa Trial | Advocate Teffo has been arrested:
