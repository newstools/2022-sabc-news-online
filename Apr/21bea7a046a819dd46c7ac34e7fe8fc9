The bail application of 27 people arrested in connection with passport fraud is underway in the Krugersdorp Magistrate’s Court on Gauteng’s West Rand. They were arrested during an early morning raid on Friday. They are believed to be part of a syndicate allegedly working with home affairs officials to fraudulently issue South African passports to foreign nationals at a cost of R40 000 each. Last week, Home Affairs Minister, Aaron Motsoaledi said the syndicate’s kingpin was working with corrupt officials of his department in a network that spanned Gauteng, Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Mpumalanga.

The court has so far heard an affidavit by the alleged kingpin into the crime and counsels for the other accused are continuing with their presentations. The courtroom is packed to capacity with the accused persons that the public gallery had to be used as an overflow. The matter had to be delayed due to the absence of a Somali interpreter. The bail hearing continues.
