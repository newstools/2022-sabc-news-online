The petrol price has increased but thanks to the government’s decision to cut the fuel levy, motorists will not deal with large fuel price increases. The price of 93 Octane petrol has gone up by 28 cents per litre while that of 95 Octane has increased by 36 cents per litre, while both grades of diesel have also increased by between R1.58-cents and R1.68 cents per litre. Poor households using paraffin have been hard hit, as they are paying R2.66 cents more per litre. Slovo informal settlement residents say they pay R19 for a litre of paraffin:  The government says the increases in petrol would have been R2 per litre and diesel R3 per litre had it not intervened. Earlier this week, the Energy Department said that sanctions imposed on Russia had disrupted energy flows, as Russia is one of the biggest global exporters of oil. This has led to a spike in crude oil prices.
