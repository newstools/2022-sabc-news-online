Chiefs Marketing Director Jessica Motaung says they will do everything by the rule book after the club was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in early December, forcing them to miss two DSTV Premiership matches. This as the club and Stadium Management South Africa are bracing themselves for a mammoth task when the Soweto giants host SuperSport United at the FNB Stadium on Saturday evening. This will be the first time the most supported club in South African football will have fans attending. “I am saying to vaccinated and non-vaccinated supporters, please come to the stadium. We have the systems that will accommodate you. If you are not vaccinated come with your test and make sure that you are going to be part of the experience,” says Motaung. This follows the lifting of the National State of Disaster regulations in the country earlier this month. The match has the potential to attract a big crowd, with Amakhosi aiming to finish at least second on the DSTV Premiership log. Stadium South Africa Chief Executive Bertie Grobbelaar says they will leave nothing to chance. “It’s a long weekend. So, that might influence ticket sales as well. You will see when you enter the venue there is more access gates open, the checking points and the scan points are not at the turnstiles … it’s just opposite the grey gate as we call it. All the turnstiles are open. We’ve installed a counting system at the turnstiles. So, there was a whole different planning around access to the venue to make it more accessible to the fans and to enhance your stadium experience,” says Grobbelaar.
