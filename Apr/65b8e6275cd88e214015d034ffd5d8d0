The Port St John’s Municipality in the Eastern Cape has urged residents to be vigilant in the next coming days. This is due to heavy rains in the area from last night and expected until next week. Cold temperatures are also expected in certain parts of the province this weekend. Heavy rains left a trail of destruction in Port St John’s earlier this week displacing scores of people. A six-year-old boy also drowned while crossing a flooded river on his way from school in Ngxongweni. Municipal Mayor Nomvuzo Mlombile-Cingo has urged residents in low-lying areas to move to safer places. “We urge therefore anyone travelling especially since its Easter weekend to avoid rivers. Make sure you stay at home if the river is full. Neighbours must do what we are known for as Africans. Those who still have safe houses must help others. As Port St Johns Municipality we have that Youth Centre hall where anyone experiencing any challenge can go.” Residents of Port St Johns in the Eastern Cape displaced by floods:
