South Africa wants to explore new possibilities of economic, trade and investment cooperation in Guinea Bissau. President Cyril Ramaphosa will host his Guinea Bissau counterpart General Umaro Sissoco Embaló during a state visit at the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Thursday morning. Relations between South Africa and Guinea-Bissau date back to the days of the common struggle against colonialism and apartheid led by both the ANC and the African Party for the Independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde – the PAIGC. The two countries established their diplomatic relations in 1994 following South Africa’s all-race elections with Pretoria opening its embassy in Guinea Bissau in 2008. And with a two-way trade of less than R2 million, both countries want to re-invigorate a number of bilateral agreements. And for its part, Pretoria wants to increase its trade and investment in the areas of agro-processing, defence, infrastructure and mining. The two leaders are also expected to share views on regional, continental and global issues particularly peace, security and economic development.
