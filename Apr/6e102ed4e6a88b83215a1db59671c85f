The Mayor of the Overstrand Municipality, in the Western Cape, Annelie Rabie  is calling for a progress report of the investigation into the murder of matric student Sisipho Mayile of Zwelihle township in Hermanus. Her body was found in January shortly after she had disappeared. The Speaker of the Western Cape Provincial Legislature, Masizole Mnqasela, led a march against gender-based violence to the local police station. Rabie is calling for more information to be made available. “We believe that it should not be necessary for anyone to have to have any kind of these marches for SAPS (South African Police Service) to actually do their work. We would like to have the progress report of have they found anyone because we believe previously, two people were arrested and were subsequently released. So what are the true facts? Today’s march underscores again that no one is above the law,” says Rabie.
