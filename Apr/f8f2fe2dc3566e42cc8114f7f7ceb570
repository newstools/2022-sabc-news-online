Civil society organisation Accountability Now has accused Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane of employing known delaying tactics to avoid being held accountable. This follows Mkhwebane approaching the Western Cape High Court for an order to interdict Parliament from continuing with its inquiry into her fitness to hold office until her application has been heard on April 25. She wants the court to order National Assembly Speaker Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula to withdraw her letter to President Cyril Ramaphosa informing him of the resumption of the Parliamentary inquiry. Accountability Now director, Paul Hoffman says her tactics are known to the courts. “The Public Protector is seeking to defer, and delay, and duck and dive, as much as she can. Because she knows that her term in office will be over in October next year. So, if she’s able to string out litigation process as long as possible, then she may well get to the end of her term of office, before there is any finding against her,” adds Hoffman. Parliament committee continuing with processes against Mkhwebane:  Earlier, she said she believes there’s a moratorium on Ramaphosa’s intention to suspend her until the matter is heard in court. The ten-day period that Ramaphosa afforded Mkhwebane to furnish him with reasons why she should not be suspended has already ended.
