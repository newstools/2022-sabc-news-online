The South African Swimming Championships are currently under way in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape with competitive rivalry between Chad le Clos and Mathew Sates being a highlight. Le Clos redeemed himself by winning the 100 metres butterfly, coming in at under 52 seconds after being denied victory by Matthew Sates in the 200 metres freestyle the day before. Le Clos  and Sates had this to say about their rivalry Le Clos says: “Of course, Mathew pushed me all the way. A lot of respect for him and he had a phenomenal week, he’s got a phenomenal future ahead so glad to have raced him and we can both push each other to hopefully further heights, especially in the 100 fly but delighted with the win I think that’s also my 13th consecutive 100 fly win at nationals. big shout out to the crowd, it was really cool to hear them in the last 25, really pushed me in the last couple of meters. Sates says, “Every time I come and race I want to win. So I didn’t get it yesterday, Chad got the out touch. Chad is a big inspiration; glad he got the win. It’s always nice racing Chad, it’s always fun. It’s good to be back in South Africa also.
