The Ntlatseng family, in Schweizer-Reneke in North West, says they are still battling to come to terms with their loss. The family lost 15 members in a head-on collision that claimed 19 lives on the R34 road between Bloemhof and Schweizer-Reneke in February. They say holidays have been the most difficult period for the surviving family, which is still battling to accept what happened. The healing journey for the family is an uphill battle. 74-year-old Gert Ntlatseng lost his wife of 37 years, seven of their 10 children, and seven grandchildren, the youngest of whom was a four-year-old girl. The deceased all lived in a family home. Now, the home, which was once vibrant and noisy, is filled with sadness and quietness. Ntlatseng says, “It has been very difficult. Sometimes I would cry and ask where people are. I was used to living with those people and I had hoped that they would take care of me.” A grandchild, Lebogang Ntlatseng, says life for the family is still difficult as the remaining grandchildren depend on the grandfather’s pension. Grandchild Lebogang Ntlatseng says, “Government had promised us that they would assist us with getting jobs. But nothing so far. There’s a water project from Mloemhof to Schweizer-Reneke but not a single person from our family was considered.” The family is pleading for assistance to better their current situation, especially employment opportunities.
