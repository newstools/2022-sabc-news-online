A Limpopo-born seasoned boxing champion Tshifhiwa “Atomic Spider” Munyai will defend his national lightweight title against Aphiwe Mboyiya from the Eastern Cape. Munyai will defend the title for the third time. The fight will be held at the Steve Tshwete Banquet Hall in Middelburg, Mpumalanga, on Saturday. Munyai’s opponent Mboyiya is a former IBO All Africa Junior lightweight and WBO Junior lightweight champion. Munyai says he wanted the fight against Mboyiya for the past five years. “I’m expecting him to come to fight. He is a good and experienced fighter. He has been in the game for a long time, I can probably say he is one of the most difficult fighters that I have met so far in the lightweight.  I’m expecting him to do a good job to give the best out of me,” says Munyai.
