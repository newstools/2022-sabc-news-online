The data shows that about 2,5% of people with physical disabilities have mild difficulty in walking, while 1% reported having severe difficulty in walking a kilometre or climbing a flight of stairs. Olifant shares her journey with a disability, personal achievements, aspirations and challenges with SABC Digital News producer, Lebo Tshangela in this bi-weekly feature, Thrive.  “We really need to believe in ourselves, and people who acquire a disability along the way, they should not give up and lose hope.
