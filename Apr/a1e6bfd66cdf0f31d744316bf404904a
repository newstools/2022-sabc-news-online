The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) will continue to interview candidates for various superior courts on Wednesday. A Judge President of the High Court Division of the North West will be the first to be interviewed. There are also two vacancies for the Eastern Cape Division of the High Court and one for the Gauteng Division of the High Court for secondment to the Land Claims Court. On Tuesday night, the JSC recommended four of the five candidates who were interviewed for two vacant positions in the Constitutional Court following deliberations. One of the five candidates, Justice David Unterhalter, failed to make it on the list. Unterhalter apologised after admitting an error of judgment on his part after he failed to recuse himself in a Constitutional Court matter which he had dismissed while he was acting in the Supreme Court of Appeal. “So  I should point out that I am entirely alive to this problem that has sat in a number of courts,  one has to be alive to the fact that you may have sat previously. This is just a petition that I did not recognise, I already sat on. And for that, I did make a mistake and I apologised.” Below is a live stream of the interviews:
