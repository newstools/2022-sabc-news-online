Universal Music Group announced on Thursday an expansive, long-term partnership with global music icon The Weeknd. UMG’s Republic Records has been The Weeknd’s label home and partner since 2012 and will remain his label partner for future recorded music releases. Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) will administer all of The Weeknd’s future works and songwriting catalogue in a new long-term deal, upon expiration of his existing commitment. Bravado, UMG’s leading brand-management and merchandise company, will continue to work closely with The Weeknd & XO to expand and develop global merchandising, branding, ecommerce and retail licensing opportunities around future projects and releases. Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, professionally known as The Weeknd, has earned critical and commercial success. He holds several streaming and BIllboard chart records, including the record for the longest-charting song in Billboard history, Blinding Lights, which achieved an unprecedented 90 weeks on the Hot 100 chart.
