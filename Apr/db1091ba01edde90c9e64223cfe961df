Ministers brief the media in KZN:  She told the media in Durban on Friday that the floods had completely destroyed around four-thousand homes “For Human Settlements we sitting at almost four-thousand [homes]that has been quantified to have been totally destroyed and eight-thousand partially destroyed. And we are say this cautiously as this is not a conclusive figure because assessments continue and there will be areas where we have not been able to access to do the assessment of the damages of the homes so as that happens the possibility is that the number will go higher.” Fuel shortages Businesses, residents and motorists are starting to feel the effects of the floods in as several filling stations across the eThekwini Municipality report fuel shortages.
