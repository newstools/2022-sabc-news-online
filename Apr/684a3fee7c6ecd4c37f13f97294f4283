The extent of the damage that the recent floods have caused in the Eastern Cape is yet to be established. Residents of the Mbizana-based Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Municipality have also been affected. Thirty houses have collapsed and 12 bridges as well as roads have been washed away in their area. Schooling has also been disrupted. Municipal mayor Daniswa Mafumbatha says six of the people who have died in KwaZulu-Natal are from Mbizana. “About 12 bridges that have been washed away and also the roads, the provincial, national and the access roads have been heavily damaged…there are those learners that are unable to go to school because of the bridges that have been washed away. I think the condition in the Winnie Madikizela Mandela Municipality is very bad. As we have started to see the sun, other houses are starting to collapse because you know that our houses are muddy houses.” Displaced residents Residents of Port St Johns displaced by floods have since been accommodated in community halls and recently built empty RDP houses.
