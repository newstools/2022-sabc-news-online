The postponed elective conference of the African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape is now set to take place from the 6th until the 8th  May. It was due to sit this weekend. The party says it has declared that 91% of its branches are in good standing, surpassing the 70% threshold for a conference to sit. The party has further settled the 160 disputes which were lodged by branches. The conference is expected to host 1 500 voting and 200 non-voting delegates. The coordinator of the provincial task team, Lulama Ngcukayitobi says they have beefed up security measures to ensure a violence-free conference. “The fact that we had to postpone the provincial conference was to ensure that the provincial and national disputes committees are given enough space and time to deal with the work and disputes and do so as meticulous as possible so that gave them time to do work diligently so we are certain to do whatever it takes to ensure the organisation goes to conference.” Eastern Cape ANC’s provincial congress postponed: Gift Ngqondi  The Free State and North West The ANC in the Free State and North West are expected to hold their long-awaited provincial conferences this year. Mabe says both provinces have confirmed the work done in preparation for both regional and provincial conferences. The ANC in the two provinces has faced leadership challenges in the past. Mabe says both provinces, which are under the leadership of the ANC Interim Provincial Committees, will hold their conferences between May and June. “So, we are expecting that the provincial conference of Free State and that of the North West as per the conclusion of our last NEC would sit between May and June. So, if there are issues really that hamper them sitting within that period the leadership of the IPC will give us those reasons.”
