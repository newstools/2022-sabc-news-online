The Western Cape Department of Social Development says they have allocated R4.5 million for the establishment of a new homeless shelter at the former Robbie Nurock Clinic in Cape Town. The department hopes to have the shelter operational by the end of the current financial year. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the department has increased the number of bed spaces in their shelters from 1 500 to 2 499. Ministerial spokesperson Joshua Chigome says once completed the new shelter will accommodate up to 100 people at a time. “We are pleased that we are moving forward with this much-needed project, which looks to expand the existing network for safe spaces for homeless citizens living in the Western Cape. We remain committed to ensuring that shelter services are delivered in ways that help homeless citizens gain access to essential and basic social services that promote their dignity and well-being,” says Chigome.
