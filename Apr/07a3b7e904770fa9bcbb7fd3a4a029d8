The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva has called on South Africa and other countries to start building resilience against climate change. This is after President Cyril Ramaphosa said he believed the recent floods in KwaZulu-Natal were linked to climate change. KZN FLOODS | President Ramaphosa offers condolences to families bereaved from floods: Georgieva has conveyed a message of condolence to the families of those who have died in the KwaZulu-Natal floods. “If you want to build adaptation to climate shocks, you need time to put policies in place and get the results of these policies and talking about climate change. I just want to express my deepest sympathy to the families of the people in Durban that have been affected by the floods, for the loss of life and for the tremendous suffering. Unfortunately, these risks are growing and we at the IMF see our role to direct resources from our members towards addressing these risks,” says Georgieva.
