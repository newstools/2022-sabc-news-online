Former Gauteng Health MEC and African National Congress (ANC) Chief Whip Brian Hlongwa is expected to be back in court on Friday. Hlongwa was granted R20 000 bail following allegations of a multi-million rand tender fraud case. He previously appeared in court with his wife, Joeline Davids-Hlongwa, and six others.  They all face charges ranging from fraud, corruption, money laundering and racketeering. They have been charged under the Prevention of Organised Crime Act for the alleged offences committed between 2006 and 2010. The matter was postponed for further investigation.
