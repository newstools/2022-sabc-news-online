Emergency services workers in parts of the Buffalo City Metro and Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape have downed tools over grievances including what they say are poor working conditions and staff shortages. The Department of Health says the strike is unprotected. The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) says it is not aware of a strike by any of its members. The department says 23 emergency fleet vehicles have been damaged. Private ambulances have been pelted with stones. Eastern Cape Health Department spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo says the incidents have been reported to the police. He says they will implement the principle of no-work no pay. “We are considering an interdict against the action and a principle of no work no pay[ will apply]. We equally urge those workers who are involved in this illegal strike to return to work with immediate effect. We cannot afford to put the lives of our people at risk. We provide essential services to our people, we [are] expected to ensure that we save lives,” adds Kupelo.
