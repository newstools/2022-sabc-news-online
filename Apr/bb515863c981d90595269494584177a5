Operation Dudula’s leader in Durban, Philani Gumede, has appeared in the Durban Magistrate Court on Wednesday on charges of incitement to public violence and the contravention of the Cyber Crimes Act. It’s alleged that 36-year-old Gumede created and forwarded a voice note to members of Operation Dudula, saying people should gather and remove foreign nationals, lock up their shops and remove their goods. Operation Dudula is a movement that has been seen in different parts of the country protesting and demanding foreign nationals to produce proof that they are legal in the country. The movement is planning a march in Durban on Sunday to launch the movement in KwaZulu-Natal. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Spokesperson, Natasha Ramkisson-Kara says Gumede was granted R5 000 bail. One of the conditions is that he may not use social media to incite violence. The case has been remanded to May 24.
