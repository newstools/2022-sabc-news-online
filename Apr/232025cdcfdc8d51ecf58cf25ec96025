Water and Sanitation Minister, Senzo Mchunu says, water infrastructure in four municipalities at the OR Tambo District have been damaged by the recent floods that wreaked havoc in the Eastern Cape. Mchunu has been part of an inter-ministerial visit to areas affected by the floods alongside, Human settlement Minister Mmamakolo Kubayi and Minister of Small Business development Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams. Nyandeni, King Sabatha Dalindyebo, Port St Johns and Mhlontlo are the affected local municipalities leaving thousands of residents without water. Mchunu says water tankers have been dispatched to all affected areas. He says, “Where there’s no water for instance in Nyandeni, there has been a deployment of three tankers already; Mhlontlo two tankers, PSJ three tankers already, and KSD three tankers already. I must emphasise that on these matters we are working with together with OR District.” Ndabeni-Abrahams says a R100 million has been set aside to assist under-insured and un-insured small businesses in KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape. She says, “We are aware of the conditions that our people go through, either they are under-insured if they are insured at all, because in most cases they are not insured at all. This is why, as the department, we said there’s a need for us to come up with a particular relief in order to assist those who are uninsured and under-insured. Minister Patel has also made an intervention through IDC as we avail R50 million, they will also avail R50 million that is looking into both provinces.” VIDEO: Update on Eastern Cape floods with Zimkhitha Macingwane:
