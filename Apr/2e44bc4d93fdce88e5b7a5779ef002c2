The N1 between Verkeerdevlei and Winburg in the Free State has finally been reopened after a crash involving two trucks that claimed the lives of three people. In one of the trucks, both the driver and his co-driver were killed. The road was closed for much of Sunday. Officials say the diesel spillage took longer than expected to clean up. Vehicles travelling on the N1 from Bloemfontein were diverted to the Karee Dam offramp with traffic from Winburg being diverted to the Brandfort road. Emergency Medical Services Spokesperson Sipho Towa said police are still investigating the cause of the accident. “They are busy with clean up and after clean up they will also do spillage clean up. What’s taking long is because of the diesel spillage at the scene. So we urge road users to be patient and to follow the diversion rules as directed by the law enforcement agencies.”
