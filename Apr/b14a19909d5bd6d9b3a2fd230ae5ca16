African National Congress (ANC) spokesperson Pule Mabe says the ANC’s NEC has resolved that members affected by the step-aside rule will no longer be eligible to contest for the ANC’s positions. Mabe says their members affected by the guidelines at the conclusion of the conference where they would have been elected, they should have done the honourable thing and written to the organisation that they recognise their election, but while their cases are pending they will be stepping aside from their responsibility as is required by the ANC. The ANC convened a one-day special National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting to process policy discussion documents on Sunday, via a virtual platform. Mabe says elected members affected the policy should step aside but that does not in any way suggest that the member is guilty of wrongdoing.  ANC Women’s League NEC disbanded ANC NEC) has disbanded the Women’s League NEC. The disbandment comes after recommendations from the party’s Task Team led by Thandi Modise and Nathi Mthethwa. After weeks of speculation on the future of the league, the Special NEC has finally taken a decision, ultimately sealing the fate of the structure elected in 2015. The main reason for the disbandment of the Women’s League NEC is that the structure has been in office since 2015 and its five year term of office had expired. The ANC NEC met during a special session over the weekend. The NEC meeting was held in preparation for the party’s National Policy Conference to be held at the end of July and the National Elective Conference in December 2022.
