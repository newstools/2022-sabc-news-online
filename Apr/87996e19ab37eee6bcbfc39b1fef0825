French President Emmanuel Macron attacked far-right challenger Marine Le Pen battled on Wednesday over her ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Macron’s strongest line of attack against his far-right rival at the start of the debate was her past admiration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a loan for the 2017 campaign contracted through a Russian bank and her recognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea. “You depend on the Russia power, you depend on Mr Putin. You took out a loan from a Russian bank,” Macron told his opponent. Le Pen rejected the accusations, saying: “I am a completely free and independent woman.” The election presents voters with two opposing visions of France: Macron offers a pro-European, liberal platform, while Le Pen’s nationalist manifesto is founded on deep euro scepticism. Much haggling went on behind the scenes ahead of the debate, from the temperature of the room to flipping a coin to decide which theme they would start with – the cost of living – to who would speak first – Le Pen. Last time they faced off in a debate, in 2017, Le Pen’s presidential challenge unravelled as she mixed up her notes and lost her footing. After more than half of the electorate voted for far-right or hard left candidates in the first round, Macron’s lead in opinion polls is much narrower than five years ago, when he beat Le Pen with 66.1% of the vote. Voter surveys on Wednesday projected he would win with 55.5-56.5% this time.
