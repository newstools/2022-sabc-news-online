International Relations and Co-operation Minister, Dr Naledi Pandor says South Africa has resisted becoming embroiled in the politics of confrontation and aggression in Ukraine. Pandor says they have asserted their independent and non-aligned views on the matter. The Minister was addressing the media on Pretoria’s position with regard to the current conflict on Friday. Minister Naledi Pandor has defended SA’s position on the Ukraine-Russia conflict. She says one of their concerns is the seeming lack of balanced evidence in the United Nations today. Pandor adds that dialogue, mediation and diplomacy are key to the conflict in Ukraine. Pandor says, “There needs to be consistency in the approach of the international community to countries that violate international law. When Israel launched sustained offensive military operations against the Gaza strip, killing hundreds, flattening homes, burying civilians under the rubble, and devastating the already dilapidated infrastructure in such a small and densely populated area, the world failed to respond in the same way it has on Ukraine.” DIRCO Minister Dr Naledi Pandor briefs media on the ongoing conflict: At the recent UN General Assembly vote to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council, South Africa abstained and the minister indicated that they had valid reasons not to vote in favour of the resolution. Pandor says, “I’m worried if we place Russia outside of the institutions of global governance. We’re almost giving Russia licence to say do as you wish; to some degree how do we advance peace.” As Russia has been slapped with a raft of sanctions by the West, this has affected livelihoods in Moscow. SA Ambassador in Russia, Mzuvukile Maqetuka says, “I must say sanctions are worrisome on the Russian soil there hasn’t been a bomb immediately after sanctions kicked in and the mission funds are under swift.”
