Victims of Gender Based Violence (GVB) should be offered help and not be criticised for not leaving toxic relationships. Playwright and GBV survivor Kgomotso Mawasha says the psychological turmoil that comes with abuse is hard to understand. Mawasha was speaking at the two day Royal Princess Network Imbizo being held in Thaba ‘Nchu  in the Free State. The summit is discussing solutions for GBV in rural communities. Her play is set to be part of proceedings on Saturday, when the Royal Princess Network Imbizo comes to an end. “My entire campaign when it comes to GBV is how to help the survivor because people have gone about it the wrong way according to me let me say, in my personal opinion and my experience. GBV is being dealt with in the wrong way. We can have forums, marches, we can have everything but it doesn’t help the person on the ground.  There are no programmes in place for victims, where to go,” Mawasha elaborates. Meanwhile, the Thaba ‘Nchu Men’s Forum, which is also taking part in the Imbizo, says young people have lost their moral compass. The forum’s secretary Lebogang Mapota says this is the reason why there is a high prevalence of abuse of women and children. “Thaba ‘Nchu Men’s Forum has taken it upon itself to go around schools, go around churches and preach the gospel of good morality because this is the only way that we will see ourselves developing the nation of our country,” says Mapota.
