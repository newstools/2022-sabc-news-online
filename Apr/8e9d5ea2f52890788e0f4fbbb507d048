Convicted murderer and former police officer Rosemary Nomia Ndlovu’s case has been postponed to the 25th of next month. She appeared briefly in the Kempton Park Magistrates’ Court, east of Johannesburg. Ndlovu is currently serving six life sentences for orchestrating hits on her family members to cash in on insurance policies. She appeared on two separate matters. The former Tembisa police officer returned to the dock… this time at the Kempton Park Magistrates Court. She is facing charges for allegedly plotting the murder of Sergeant Benneth Mabunda and Colonel Nthipe Boloka. Mabunda was the investigating officer in Ndlovu’s initial case. She also appeared with co-accused Nomsa Mudau on a second matter. The two are accused of conspiring to have Mudua’s partner killed. The matter was postponed to the 25th May to allow the pair to get legal representation. Six life sentences Last year, the High Court sitting in Palm Ridge handed the former police officer six life sentences for murder, attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice and fraud. Ndlovu killed six of her relatives and benefitted from insurance claims to the value of over R1.4-million. The murders Ndlovu has been found guilty of: The former police officer was arrested in 2018 following a sting operation which ultimately led to her being caught on camera while allegedly detailing what she wanted to be done by the alleged hitmen when they kill her sister Joyce and her five children. During cross-examination, state prosecutor, Rianna Williams told the court that she was in possession of cellphone records, which proved that Ndlovu made multiple calls to two alleged hitmen, one of whom was an undercover police officer, known as Mr. Dlamini. In a secretly recorded video, Ndlovu can be seen and heard telling Mr. Dlamini to burn Joyce and her five kids leaving behind no witnesses so that they could cash in on insurance policies.
