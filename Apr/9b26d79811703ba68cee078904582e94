Orlando Pirates are through to the semi-final of the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Confederations Cup following a 4-3 win on penalties against Simba SC of Tanzania at the Orlando stadium in Soweto on Sunday evening. The second leg quarterfinal match finished 1-nil to the Buccaneers in regulation time as Ghanaian Kwame Peprah found the back of the net in the second half with a pouncing header. Simba also won by the same scoreline last week, which made the aggregate score to be 1-All. The match was then decided by a penalty shootout where Pirates’ goalkeeper was a hero for saving one penalty kick and scoring the winner.
