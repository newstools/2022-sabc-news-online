The office of the Secretary General of the African National Congress (ANC) is working closely with the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) of the governing party in the North West to prepare for the elective conference next month. The IPC was set up in 2019 following the dissolution of the Supra Mahumapelo led PEC and Professor Job Mokgoro-led Task Team. It was supposed to have taken the party to the conference in 2020, but that was delayed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The conference has been postponed twice this year already. The National Spokesperson of the ANC, Pule Mabe says the provincial structure must go to conference. Mabe says, “They are expected to sit, at their provincial conference next month. So, we are giving them every support they may need, to make sure that they ultimately achieve that desire.” “There’s an interface between the office of the SG and the office of the coordinator in the North West, to understand the state of the organisation there, and effectively establish what needs to be done, to really assist in making sure that ultimately the conference goes to conference to make sure that they elect the leadership, they can sanction and execute a political program that unites all the people of the North West,” he adds.
