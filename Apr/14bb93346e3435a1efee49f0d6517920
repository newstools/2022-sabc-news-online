The National Liquor Traders Council (NLTC) has pledged at least R2-million to support businesses and communities that have suffered losses during the flooding in KwaZulu-Natal. It says the support will be in a form of credit allowances for liquor traders, working towards restocking and rebuilding their businesses.

So we are doing our part. The donation is in 3 parts: 1. Food parcels. 2. Assist traders to get credit once they open their doors and sell again. 3. We are looking at assisting in terms of rebuilding their premises. In that regard, we have partnered with one of the top banks to be able to assist with loans that have low interest rates,” says NTLC’s spokesperson Lucky Ntimane.
