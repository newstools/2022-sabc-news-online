A suspect arrested in connection with a mass shooting in Enkanini, on the Cape Flats in the Western Cape, has briefly appeared in the Khayelitsha Magistrate’s Court. 35-year-old Thando Shuba faces charges relating to the shooting of two women and four men in the informal settlement. The killings took place two weeks ago. The matter has been postponed until later this week. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Spokesperson, Eric Ntabazalila says the murder suspect remains in custody. “The prosecutor, advocate Ntsikelelo Peter, told the court that the investigating officer still needs to verify the video footage which the accused used as an alibi. His case was then remanded until Friday, 8 April 2022, for further investigation,” says Ntabazalila.
