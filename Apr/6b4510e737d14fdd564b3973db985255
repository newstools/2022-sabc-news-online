Residents of Bloemfontein have started to arrive at the Dr Rantlai Petrus Molemela in Rocklands for the Presidential Imbizo. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to hear the concerns of communities and speak about the district development model in the Free State. The video below is the live stream of the Presidential Imbizo in the Free State:  Ramaphosa kicked off the Imbizo with a site visit to inspect the newly constructed Vereeniging Interchange followed by the Motheo TVET Artisan College Project. He was accompanied by various government ministers, the Premier of the province as well as MECs on the site visits. The community engagement programme takes place at the stadium from 11am. Meanwhile, Cabinet has decided to put the Mangaung municipality under national administration after a series of governance failures and financial mismanagement. The Mangaung municipality is one of the country’s eight metros that has failed on multiple fronts. It was placed under the provincial administration in 2019 after failing to implement a financial recovery plan from the previous year. But the situation worsened forcing the national government to take charge of its administration. Residents say service delivery is almost non-existent with intermittent water cuts, roads in a state of disrepair and refusal taking weeks if not months. President Ramaphosa is worried and vows to turn things around. Several Ministers will be on the ground this morning as a build-up to the president’s visit.
