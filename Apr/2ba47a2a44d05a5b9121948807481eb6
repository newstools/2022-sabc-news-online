ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has called on the ANC in Mpumalanga to carefully reflect on the issue of ‘step aside’ as part of the party’s national elective conference resolutions of 2017. The 13th Mpumalanga conference has elected Mandla Msibi as the party’s Treasurer in the province, even though he’s facing a double murder charge at the High Court in Nelspruit. He couldn’t be at the conference this weekend, because he had stepped aside after he was officially charged. ANC President Ramaphosa’s closing remarks at Mpumalanga conference:  Ramaphosa says this will need to be addressed vigorously by the newly elected leadership and the ANC branches. He says this forms part of the renewal project in the ANC. “You took the step of yes, endorsing and electing one of the comrades who is facing charges. Now, I know that you have reflected on this and you’re going to do further reflections. This matter does need your reflection as a disciplined membership of this organisation. Your reflection must be based on the decisions that have been taken by our national conference.” Rally behind new leadership Ramaphosa has also called on members of the ANC in the province to rally behind the current leadership elected this weekend. Mandla Ndlovu was elected as the party provincial chairperson and Speedy Mashilo as his Deputy. Ramaphosa says the members are duty-bound to support their leadership, even those who have not voted for those leaders. He says it is important to build a united organisation and has been encouraged by the outcome of the conference.
