It was all smiles for the homeless people in Nelson Mandela Bay as they spent their Easter Monday with a warm and hearty lunch at City Hall in Kariega. The lunch was served by a Non-Profit Organisation, The Mother’s Gift. Over a hundred homeless people, including vulnerable children, benefited from the lunch. Although this could well be the first and the last meal of the day for these homeless people, it meant a lot for them. “We have no shelter. We are living on the streets. No one is taking care of us. But mama Sheila is here taking care of us making sure we have something for the day, so we can survive for the next day,” says one of the beneficiaries. “I’m suffering I’m not working. So I’m suffering I do not even have shoes now to wear. So this is very supportive.” The project to feed the homeless around the Metro was started in 2018 by the 72-year-old founder of The Mothers’ Gift, Sheila Isaacs. She says since then it has grown, with more homeless people benefiting from it. “They are sleeping in front of businesses. That is when I decided, let’s do lunch for them. We will be serving them pickled fish. They can’t afford to buy fish.” Easter Monday brings cheer to the homeless in Nelson Mandela Bay:
