President Cyril Ramaphosa says the United States (US) and South Africa (SA) have agreed to improve bilateral relations during a call with US counterpart Joe Biden. The President said he had a telephonic discussion of almost an hour with Biden on a wide range of issues on Friday. Speaking to the media on the sidelines of his visit to Mangaung as part of the Presidential Imbizo, the president says they discussed trade, the climate and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. He said they both agreed on how to cushion developing countries from the impact of climate change. I had a productive call with US President @JoeBiden earlier this evening. As part of deepening relations, we agreed to set up a team to strengthen trade, increase investment in infrastructure and work to tackle climate change. pic.twitter.com/NTris3xHfr — Cyril Ramaphosa  (@CyrilRamaphosa) April 8, 2022  President Ramaphosa on his conversation with US counterpart Biden:  First African-American woman on the US Supreme Court Meanwhile, President Cyril Ramaphosa also congratulated US President Joe Biden on the confirmation of the first African American woman on the US Supreme Court. Biden hosted Jackson at the White House to watch the vote on television, posting on Twitter a selfie he took of them smiling after Senate acted. Jackson will take the 83-year-old Breyer’s place on the liberal bloc of a court with an increasingly assertive 6-3 conservative majority. Breyer is due to serve until the court’s current term ends – usually in late June – and Jackson would be formally sworn in after that. Jackson served early in her career as a Supreme Court clerk for Breyer. Historic moment for our courts and for our country. Congratulations, Judge Jackson. pic.twitter.com/eLSfs1QoHB — President Biden (@POTUS) April 7, 2022
