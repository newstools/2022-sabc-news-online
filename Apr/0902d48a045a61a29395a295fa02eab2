A system failure has disrupted services at Home Affairs offices nationwide. Acting Director-General Thulani Mavuso says a cable breakage that connects to the State Information Technology Agency has caused the problem. Mavuso says Home Affairs services are currently limited to passport collections and handwritten death certificates will be issued for burial purposes, with computerised certificates to be issued when the system is back online. Mavuso says a team of technicians is attending to the problem. “This is a rather regretted situation, was unforeseen. It happened this morning when we were preparing for the start of our day. We regret the inconvenience that has been caused to our members. Technology at times faces a number of challenges particularly relating to breakage either as a result of vandalism and also stolen cables that happen from time to time. We regret this incident, and we are going to restore it as soon as possible.” JUST IN Home Affairs system offline countrywide due to cable breakage.#SABCNEWS pic.twitter.com/b5sAB1sBq6 — Chriselda ‘Babes We Ndaba’ Lewis (@Chriseldalewis) April 1, 2022
