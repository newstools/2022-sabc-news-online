The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) has reported 1 659 new COVID-19 cases that have been identified in South Africa, which brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases to 3 735 578. This increase represents a 7.5% positivity rate. The majority of new cases on Wednesday are from Gauteng Province (47%), followed by Western Cape (23%). The institute says due to the ongoing audit exercise by the National Department of Health (NDoH), there may be a backlog of COVID-19 mortality cases reported. “Today, the NDoH reports 16 deaths, and of these, one occurred in the past 24 – 48 hours. This brings the total fatalities to 100 132 to date,” says the institute in a statement. 24 116 414 tests have been conducted in both public and private sectors.
