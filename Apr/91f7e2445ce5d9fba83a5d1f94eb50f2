The South African Football Association (SAFA) match commissioner, Matankiso Titi will be buried in her hometown of Bethlehem in the Free State on Saturday. The 48-year-old Titi’s memorial service will be held on Wednesday in Bethlehem. She was among five people who were killed on Friday afternoon in a head-on collision between a car and a truck on the R57 between Heilbron and Sasolburg in the Free State. She was on her way to officiate in the DStv Diski Challenge match between Sekhukhune United and Mamelodi Sundowns. Among others, Titi was a Referees Instructor and a member of SAFA’s National Referees Committee. She was also a proud holder of a much sought-after FIFA badge during her time as an assistant referee between 2004 and 2010.
