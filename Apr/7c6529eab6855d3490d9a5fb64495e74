The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) says it has averted a bus strike over the long Easter weekend. The union says it has received a revised offer from the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council (SARPBAC) and its affiliates in the bus passenger sector. In a statement the union says employers have proposed a 4.5% increase across the board. This includes allowances. They have also agreed to withdraw the threat of implementing increases only for those workers who are currently employed as of March 31 2022. This means the increases would also be applicable to those who join the company after. NUMSA spokesperson, Phakamile-Hlubi Majola says: “In the meantime, we will be engaging our members to find out how they feel about the proposal. We want to make it clear that the possibility of strike action remains, as long as we have not signed an agreement with the employer. We will be spending the next couple of days engaging with our members all over the country in order to get a mandate on the proposed offer. We will be meeting again with employers on the 22nd of April to give them feedback.”
