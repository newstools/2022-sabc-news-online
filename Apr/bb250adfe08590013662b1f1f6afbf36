The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has reiterated a warning against complacency in COVID-19 preventative measures, as several countries record increases in new infections. South Africa has recorded 4 406 new cases the past 24-hours, resulting in a 15.8 % test positivity rate. Experts say the country may experience its fifth coronavirus wave in early May. The government has warned that the country may return to National State of Disaster if cases continue to increase:  The Director of the Africa CDC, Dr John Nkengasong, has called on people who have not yet been vaccinated or received booster shots to ensure they get vaccinated. “We cannot be complacent. We are still in the pandemic. This virus tends to lure you into a false sense of complacency and it comes back over and over. This is the period to increase our vaccinations. The virus is not gone.” Below are the latest coronavirus statistics:  APR 2022 4 406 5 3 750 830 24 262 108 100 276 3 631 082 34 469 342 656 834 21 930 193 643 4 774 667 099 16 070 109 171 3 220 1 223 983 20 680 156 172 4 617 194 041 4 705 203 168 7 671 346 719 16 609 North West Northern Cape Western Cape Eastern Cape Limpopo Kwa-Zulu Natal Free State Gauteng Mpumalanga 21 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
