KwaZulu-Natal police have seized drugs worth R7 million at a house in Umhlanga north of Durban. A 36-year-old man has been arrested and is expected to appear in court soon. Police say when they raided his house, the suspect was busy packaging the drugs. A 29-year-old woman was also arrested for being in the country illegally. Police spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says, “he was found in possession of 17,45kg of cocaine powder, 8470 pieces of rock cocaine, 155 moons of cocaine, 714 mandrax tablets, 78 ecstasy tablets and 46 orange and white capsules of heroin. The suspect was placed under arrest for possession as well as dealing in drugs. The recovered drugs are valued at approximately 7 million. While the team was busy conducting a search, a 29-year-old woman obstructed police officers from executing their duties. It was established that she was in the country illegal. She was placed under arrest for defeating the ends of justice and also for immigration Act.” Last month, Kimberley residents have chased away two foreign shop owners out of the city, after searching their shops and allegedly finding drugs and a large sum of cash stashed in a safe. The raids were conducted following a tip-off that some of the food outlets around town are being used as a front for drug peddling. Two foreign shop owners had to close shop, their goods were confiscated and doors locked. They were instructed to never return to the city.
