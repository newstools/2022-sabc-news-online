The South African Communist Party (SACP) in the North West will hold its 9th provincial congress at Stilfontein in the Matlosana Local Municipality from Friday morning. The congress, which will be addressed by both SACP General Secretary Blade Nzimande and North West Premier Bushy Maape will also elect the new leadership of the province. The congress is, amongst others, expected to discuss the state of affairs in both the provincial government and the African National Congress in the province. The question of whether the SACP should contest the coming national elections will also be debated. All resolutions taken from the provincial congress will be consolidated and presented as a position of the province at the SACP national congress in July.
