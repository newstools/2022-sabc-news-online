Former Gauteng Premier Mbhazima Shilowa says his former late spokesperson Thabo Masebe was a gifted communicator of high integrity, ethical conduct and revolutionary morality. Masebe passed away on Monday. He started as a government communicator in Shilowa’s office from 1999 until 2008 and also served as a spokesperson for former President Kgalema Motlanthe. He was the Acting Director General in the office of the current Gauteng Premier David Makhura at the time of his passing. Shilowa says, unlike many government communicators, Masebe managed to separate his political affiliation from his government responsibilities. “People must remember Thabo as someone who didn’t believe in a spin for his principal. But he believed that what is important is to communicate as truthfully as is possible. Secondly, he was highly political but no one will say to you in the nine years I have worked with him that they have ever seen him with me at any political activities. He separated his work as a communicator in the office of the Premier from his work as a political person. He could be called upon to go and assist at Luthuli House or at Walter Sisulu House, but he was also very clear that he does that in his own spare time.” Acting DG, Thabo Masebe, in the Office of Gauteng Premier passes away:
