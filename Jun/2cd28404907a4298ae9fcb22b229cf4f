The trial into the murder of former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana goalkeeper Senzo Meyiwa continues on Tuesday afternoon in the North Gauteng High Court. Earlier in the day, state witness Sergeant Thabo Mosia testified that he also finds it strange that there were traces of blood in the lounge and not on the kitchen floor where Meyiwa is said to have been shot.
