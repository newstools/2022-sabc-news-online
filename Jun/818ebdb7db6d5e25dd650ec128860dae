Johannesburg Emergency Management Services Spokesperson, Robert Mulaudzi says today’s search covered 8 kilometres, but that efforts were futile. He says their teams will continue with the search again tomorrow. “We continued with the search along the pipe and we managed to cover the second and third manhole from where the incident occurred, to the forth manhole. It is clear. We also managed to cover four other manholes which were covered because that area used to be an informal settlement. Unfortunately we couldn’t locate anything along that line. @CityofJoburgEMS We are in Dlamini again this morning as we continue with the search of a 6 year old Khayalethu Magadla who slipped and fell into a manhole last Sunday while playing with his friends.@CityofJoburgZA @CoJPublicSafety #JoburgBravest pic.twitter.com/9kdEjtyPei
