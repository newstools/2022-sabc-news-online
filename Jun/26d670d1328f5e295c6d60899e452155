Former President Thabo Mbeki has urged the leadership of the African National Congress (ANC) to be committed to what they have agreed to in the movement. Mbeki was born in 1942 in the former homelands of Transkei in the Eastern Cape. Mbeki says he joined the ANC at the age of 14 and he was committed since then. He says he was also inspired by his father who taught him a commitment to the tasks given to him. He was addressing a gala dinner celebrating his 80th birth in Sandton, north of Johannesburg on Saturday. Friends and family of the former President attended the gala dinner.
