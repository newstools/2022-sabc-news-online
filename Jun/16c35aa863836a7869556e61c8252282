Elon Musk may walk away from his $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter Inc if the social media network fails to provide data on spam and fake accounts, the billionaire warned in a letter to the company on Monday. Twitter was in a “clear material breach” of its obligations and that Musk reserves all rights to terminate the merger agreement, the letter said. This is the first time Musk has threatened to walk away from the deal in writing as opposed to airing it on Twitter’s social media platform. Earlier in March, Musk said he would put the deal “temporarily on hold”, while he waits for the social media company to provide data on the proportion of its fake accounts. “Musk believes Twitter is transparently refusing to comply with its obligations under the merger agreement, which is causing further suspicion that the company is withholding the requested data,” according to the letter. Musk said he needed the data to conduct his own analysis of Twitter users and did not believe in the company’s “lax testing methodologies.” “Musk is clearly entitled to the requested data to enable him to prepare for transitioning Twitter’s business to his ownership and to facilitate his transaction financing,” his lawyers said in the letter. Twitter shares were down 5.5% at $37.95 in early trading. Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
