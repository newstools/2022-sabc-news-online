The Namibian Economic Freedom Fighters says it is evident that there is a corrupt relationship between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and his Namibian counterpart, Hage Geingob. This follows media reports that Ramaphosa concealed a crime of theft, money laundering and bribery at his Phala Phala game farm in Limpopo. It has also raised concerns that a sitting head of state and government has violated Namibia’s sovereignty and allowed Ramaphosa’s secret agents to invade their country in order to abduct people who are involved in a serious crime. The party has called on President Geingob to disclose all the interactions he engaged in on the instruction of Ramaphosa with the purpose of hiding a criminal activity.
