Ivorian economist Jean-Claude Brou, president of West Africa’s main political bloc, has been nominated by Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara to be governor of the regional central bank, a source familiar with the matter said. Brou has served as president of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) commission since 2018. The source said the other members of the bank are expected to formally validate his nomination to succeed another Ivorian, Tiemoko Kone, as governor of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which represents eight regional countries that use the CFA franc currency. Kone was appointed Ivory Coast’s vice president in April, leaving Ouattara the prerogative to name his successor, a senior regional source told Reuters. A bank spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.
