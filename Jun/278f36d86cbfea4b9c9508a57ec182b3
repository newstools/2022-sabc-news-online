Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula says a solution to e-tolls will be announced in October, this time for sure. Mbalula has been promising an announcement on e-tolls since he took office in May 2019, with several deadlines having come and gone. Speaking at a press briefing in Pretoria on Thursday morning, he said the decision would be made by the medium-term budget policy statement in October. The transport minister says the matter will again come before the cabinet soon. Mbalula says a decision had been taken by the cabinet a while ago which would have impacted the fuel levy. Among the suggestions tabled to pay for e-tolls in the past, has been an increase to the fuel levy in Gauteng. However, he says this is no longer a direction they are considering. The government introduced e-tolls in 2013 to pay for the upgrade of 187km freeways in Gauteng. The system makes use of electronic scanners to register vehicles’ number plates and sends drivers a bill for the distance travelled on the upgraded roads. The project has, however, been met with widespread criticism and noncompliance. The video below discusses on new e-toll and toll tariffs:
