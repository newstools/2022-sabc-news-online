The Department of Health says it will intensify the program for three years until 2025. Some young people at Mdavula say it is important to practice safe sex. “I prefer to use condoms as a safety [measure], when I am done doing that sexual what what. I am sexually active, I am clean too much. Yes, I use condoms, I protect myself using condoms and also abstain where needs be,” says one of them.
