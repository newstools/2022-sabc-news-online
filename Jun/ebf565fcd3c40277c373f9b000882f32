The newly appointed chairperson of ActionSA in Limpopo, Sello Lediga, says he plans to accelerate the growth of the party in the province. ActionSA president, Herman Mashaba, announced Lediga’s appointment during a media briefing in Polokwane. Lediga is a former senior African National Congress member. He says their aim is to become the second biggest party in the province. “Our focus is 2024. We want to be second biggest. That will only happen if we do our work in the province. I can assure you, two weeks ago you saw it right. We are determined to stir this leadership. It is not an easy decision. You don’t know yesterday was the worst day for me. I have been called many things, traitor. I want to teach them simple politics. I will start with the constitution,” says Lediga. Mashaba says they have more branches in Limpopo than anywhere else in the country. “What the team has done here in Limpopo, they have already given me an indication of the achievements. We have got more branches formed in Limpopo than anywhere else in the country. I saw a tweet this morning by our provincial chairperson in Gauteng, Ntate Bongani Baloyi. My goodness, I thought Gauteng and Joburg were ahead and welcome Kgosi Phaahla, thank you,” says Mashaba.
