In his opening address of the 7th Southern African Customs Union summit, SACU Chairperson and Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi says to achieve the SACU objectives they need to ensure seamless movement of goods and services among member states. “Guided by our aspiration for regional industrial development, we need to take lessons from what we could have done differently to inform what we do going forward. This will enable us to efficiently harness our limited resources to implement our post-Covid recovery plan. As members of the customs union, stronger regulatory and administrative collaboration can only aid us in responding in a coordinated manner to facilitate the seamless movement of goods within the common customs area. It is only through mutual partnerships that our people and traders can derive the maximum benefit from what SACU aims to achieve. “  #SACU President Masisi:I am pleased that we are able to meet physically, your presence here shows the importance SACU plays in our nation’s. #sabcnews — #LordOfTheMedia (@samkelemaseko) June 30, 2022  #SACU Masisi:We are meeting in challenging times Geo-politically.
