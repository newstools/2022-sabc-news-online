Political Analyst Khanya Vilakazi says calls from opposition parties for President Cyril Ramaphosa to step aside are justified while investigations into the robbery at his Phala Phala farm in Limpopo are conducted. “There is absolutely nothing wrong with the President of the country stepping aside for momentarily time so that the Deputy President can assume the work of the head of state pending these investigations on the matter. But secondly, when you look at the President appearing in front of the Integrity Commission. The Committee has revealed itself of being not partial to future transgressions of members of the ANC. So I think that it will rubber-stamp any and every idea that he will put forward,” adds Vilakazi. Ramaphosa is currently struggling to ward off the fallout from criminal charges filed against him by former spy boss Arthur Fraser.

He claims that no aspect of any police or other investigation prevents him from giving the country a full and honest account of events. Steenhuisen says that too many questions about the alleged robbery and the President’s failure to report it to SAPS remain unanswered.
