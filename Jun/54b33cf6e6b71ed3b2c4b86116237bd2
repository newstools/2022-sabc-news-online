 Around 36% – particularly those under 35 – say that the news lowers their mood.  “Large numbers of people see the media as subject to undue political influence, and only a small minority believe most news organisations put what’s best for society ahead of their own commercial interest,” wrote Reuters Institute Director Rasmus Kleis Nielsen in the report, which is based on an online survey of 93 432 people, conducted in 46 markets. Younger audiences are increasingly accessing the news via platforms such as TikTok, and have a weaker connection to news brands, the report found.  The growth in the number of people who pay for online news may be leveling off, with a large proportion of digital subscriptions going to a few national brands. Across 20 countries where payment for news is widespread, 17% of survey respondents paid for any online news, the same figure as last year. Payment for local news varies across markets. The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism is funded by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Thomson Reuters. The poll has a margin of error of 2-3 percentage points up or down.
