Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema says the party in Namibia will open a criminal case against the country’s President, Hage Geingob. Geingob allegedly assisted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in apprehending the suspects in the alleged burglary and theft of 4-million U.S dollars at Ramaphosa’s Phala Phala farm in Limpopo in 2020. Last week, former Intelligence Head, Arthur Fraser laid a criminal case against Ramaphosa over the money allegedly stolen by Namibians who conspired with the president’s domestic worker two years ago. Addressing media at the party’s headquarters in Braamfontein, Malema said: “The EFF in Namibia has taken on the Namibian president, they are holding him accountable, and I’m told very soon they will be opening a criminal case against the president of Namibia for violating Namibian laws when it comes to foreign currency and issues of extradition.” Geingob has reacted to news of his involvement but has denied assisting Ramaphosa. “As for the issue of South Africa ever since I took office, I am in touch with about 14 Presidents, we don’t go through secretariat we just call each other. This thing happened in South Africa, maybe there’s going to be a court case let’s see. It’s a criminal case, people came here, some were here illegally and arrested back to South Africa. I don’t know how I have done anybody a favour.” President Geingob explains in the video below:  EFF in Namibia demanding answers The party in Namibia has since said it is evident that there is a corrupt relationship between Ramaphosa and Geingob. The party has called on President Geingob to disclose all the interactions he engaged in on the instruction of Ramaphosa with the purpose of hiding a criminal activity. It is also demanding that law enforcement agencies must reveal the intimation that is linked to the case. More details in the report below:  -Additional reporting by Ditaba Tsotetsi
