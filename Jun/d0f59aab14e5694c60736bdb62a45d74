Cape Town mayor Geordin Hill-Lewis says the latest rains that fell yesterday have not stopped mop-up operations after some parts of the Province were hit by floods leading to the displacement of hundreds of people. Watch: Cape Town mayor says more rain and a cold front is expected for the Province  There are no more heavy rain forecasts for the immediate future – but another cold front is expected to hit the Province soon. Hill-Lewis says mop up operations were slowed down in some areas by the latest rains. “The rain that we had this morning was a tiny fraction of the rain we had last week Sunday and Monday, when the rain was really torrential. We had a month’s average June rainfall in just 24 hours. So, this hasn’t hampered mop up operations all that much, obviously in some areas it will slow it down slightly.” adds Hill-Lewis. Rain was predicted with temperatures reaching a high of 16 degrees. File: Hundreds displaced after homes were flooded in parts of Cape Town
