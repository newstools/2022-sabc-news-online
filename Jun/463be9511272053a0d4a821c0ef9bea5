It appears as if the ANC’s Gauteng Provincial Conference could go longer than anticipated. Voting is currently underway at the Lakes Hotel in Benoni, east of Johannesburg, where delegates are deciding on who the new provincial leadership will be. The conference was plagued by delays in the adoption of credentials, as well as a court interdict filed to halt the conference yesterday. Mzi Khumalo, who is vying for the position of Deputy Chairperson, says that there are discussions underway on how to proceed with the conference. “The discussions have two proposals; one is that let us go to commissions tonight, (and) the other proposal says let us not be seen as maliciously complying, let’s think of a special PGC and which PGC would execute the work that was supposed to be executed today,” says Khumalo.
