US first lady Jill Biden helped celebrate the opening of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s costume’s exhibit In America: In Anthology of Fashion’ on Monday in New York. “The history of American design is rich and deep. It is a story of innovation and ingenuity, of rebellion and renewal. It has often been written by those in the shadows, not recognized for their influence and art. But here at the Met, their stories are told. Their voices are raised and their work can shine,” said the first lady. This year the theme explores American fashion during the 19th and 20th centuries through approximately 100 garments presented in various settings created by 9 film directors including Martin Scorsese and Chloe Zhao. “We came up with curatorial narratives. And the idea was that the film directors would visualize those narratives in the American wings period rooms, create these very immersive experiences for visitors and it’s been extraordinary,” said head curator of the Met’s Costume Institute, Andrew Bolton. Zola writer and director, Janicza Bravo, was thrilled to see people admiring her work. was thrilled to see people admiring her work. “Oh it feels fantastic. It’s been months in the making. So, to have this moment – it’s not dissimilar to, say, making a film and then there’s your release, right? So, this is our release day and it feels fantastic to see people moving through,” explained Bravo. The exhibit will officially open to the public May 3 after the museum’s annual fundraising event, which is considered the biggest night in fashion. Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Regina King, and Lin-Manuel Miranda all serve as the event’s co-hosts. This year marks the first May ball since the pandemic. “It is really meaningful for the museum and for Anna (Wintor) for â€“ to have the first Monday in May back, the tradition back. So, it’s really meaningful for us. It seems very symbolic, too,” said Bolton.
