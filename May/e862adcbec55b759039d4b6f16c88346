Political analyst Lukhanyo Vangqa says he believes that developments at the African National Congress (ANC)’s Eastern Cape 9th provincial conference, at the East London International Convention Centre, demonstrate that the incumbent Oscar Mabuyane is able to manipulate the processes. The start of the conference was delayed, when some delegates went to court over disagreements on credentials, which would determine those allowed to vote when new provincial leadership was elected. The case has since been struck of the roll, but the conference which was supposed to end on Sunday, has now been extended to Monday. Vangqa says Mabuyane controls the levers of power. “It takes an extraordinary amount of effort for a challenger that comes in from the outside to depose an incumbent because they don’t have access to the same levers of power that we can see here. So, fortune favours the incumbent, and that’s what we see here with Oscar Mabuyane. He’s able to cull the numbers from the other faction, ensure that some of their branches are unable to even make it as voting delegates,” explains Vangqa. Below is the full interview with Political analyst Lukhanyo Vangqa:  Meanwhile, Mlibo Qoboshiyane has defended his decision to withdraw his candidacy for the position of chairperson of the ANC in the province. Qoboshiyane announced that he is supporting Babalo Madikizela for the position. He says his decision to join Madikizela is based on their common interests and not on personal gain.
