Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane has retained his position as the African National Congress (ANC) provincial chairperson after beating his rival Babalo Madikizela. Mabuyane secured 812 votes against Madikizela’s 662. Mlungisi Mvoko has been elected the party’s deputy chairperson and Lulama Ngcukayitobi the secretary-general. On Sunday, delegates were at loggerheads over credentials and this delayed the conclusion of the three-day meeting. As a result, ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has been forced to postpone the conference’s conclusion until Monday. Meanwhile, Nelson Mandela Bay ANC member Andile Lungisa is also vying for a top five position. Lungisa was the only candidate for the position of treasurer in the Madikizela’s slate. But other names contending for his position came from the floor with Zolile Williams being nominated by 25% of the delegates to square up with him.-Additional reporting by Lubabalo Dada.
