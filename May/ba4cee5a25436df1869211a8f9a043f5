Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) supporters in the Nelson Mandela Bay region of the Eastern Cape have embarked on a protest to hand over a memorandum of demands to a Shoprite retail store at Greenacres Shopping Mall. The EFF has accused the retail store of exploitation of workers and also demands transformation among the management of the retail giant. It further wants workers employed for more than three months to be given permanent jobs. EFF member of Parliament Natasha Ntlangwini says, “So they must commit today to the demands that I have given them and they can take them step by step in order solve these demands and our workers are sufffering. They are not getting a minimun wage so we want these demands to be met even or that the store is closed we know they won’t pay them a full day today.” A regional representative from the retail store accepted the memorandum of demands and says management will discuss the matter and a way forward.
