Voting is under way at the African National Congress (ANC)’s Eastern Cape 9th provincial conference. Political analyst professor Mcebisi Ndletyana, says the scenes that have unfolded at the conference, are a perfect display of how the ANC has been disfigured as a party. The provincial conference was delayed due to credential disputes. The disputes over accreditation have forced party President Cyril Ramaphosa’s closing address to be postponed to Monday evening. ANC’s Pule Mabe addresses the conference:  The party’s spokesperson Pule Mabe says there is no crisis at the conference, at which a court dismissed a group’s attempt to seek a ruling on whether certain branch members should vote. However, Professor Ndletyana says there are indications of some serious problems. “It’s quite amazing that on the day of conference, you would have all these BGM [Branch General Meetings] during these meetings, when they should have a done so two weeks ago. That tells you that, that process of having re-runs of BGMs was not handled properly. Mainly the reason for that, I think is that there were shenanigans that were happening within. You can’t not have a meeting within three weeks, when you know exactly what to do,” explains Ndletyana. Professor Mcebisi Ndletyana on the conference:
