We are very happy that we were able to protect the motorists recently which was for an indefinite period.  What is the next step? I have no doubt, soon the Minister of Finance will advise us on the trends and what measures can be put in place to stay afloat on that matter.” The Minister also said: “Extended condolences to the friends and families of former City of Johannesburg Mpho Moerane, Gospel Artist Deborah Fraser, National AIDS Council member Dr Namane Magau, Economist Mike Schussler and Actor Jamie Bartlett.”
