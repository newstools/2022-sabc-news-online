The water crisis at the Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital in Umlazi, south of Durban has not been solved. This is despite KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala, announcing that the flood damaged pipeline has been fixed. As relatives of patients at the hospital rush in during visiting hours, some were seen carrying water in containers for their loved ones. Water infrastructure was washed away by floods last month, leaving thousands without tap water in various areas of the city. One woman visiting someone at the hospital, who wanted to remain anonymous, says they bring water for their sick relative daily. She says, “They said the hospital is still without water so I decided to bring it for my relative with a five litre container since the patients are not well. They seriously need water now and then as families with loved ones admitted here in Mshiyeni, we are deeply concerned with water shortage at the hospital. We are asking government to intervene since patients here in hospital they need water to even take their pills.” VIDEO: In April, communities in and around Durban experienced water shortages due to the flood:
