Police say investigators found six head of cattle that are believed to have been stolen at the house and followed information which led them to the suspects. These anti-stock theft patrollers at Bolata village say if police had responded on time to their call for back up – the deaths of two of their members could have been avoided. “Our main challenge here in the area are people coming from Lesotho. They are stealing our cows and they are armed and we don’t have guns we are not armed so that is our main challenge here,” says one patroller.
