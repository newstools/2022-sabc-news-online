Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema says the party is working day and night to search for the suspects who killed Hillary Gardee, the daughter of the former EFF Secretary General Godrich Gardee. Hillary went missing on Friday and her body was found on the Lydenburg Road, outside Mbombela on Tuesday. The EFF leader was speaking to the media after paying his respects to the Gardee family in Mbombela, Mpumalanga, on Wednesday. Malema says at this stage they could not say that the motive for the murder was politically motivated. “We have committed to the family to find these killers. We have committed to Bheki Cele as well that he must find them before we find them. Because if we find them before him, we can’t give a guarantee as to what is going to happen. We have deployed all manner of resources on the ground to look for this criminal.” A group of EFF members is chanting outside Gardee’s house. Police activate a 72-hour plan Police in Mpumalanga are investigating a cas. e of murder. Police Minister Bheki Cele says they’ve activated a 72-hour plan to find the killer or killers of Gardee. Cele and the National Police Commissioner General Fanie Masemola went to the crime scene before visiting the Gardee family in KaMagugu.  Mpumalanga police spokesperson Donald Mdluli says a team of experts has been established to investigate the case “There’s a team of experts that has been set up to investigate this case. They started from the scene of the crime where the body was found yesterday. They have been working throughout the night to make sure that within the 72 hours, they are able to make a breakthrough. We believe that the team that has been set up will come up with something concrete.” EFF leadership visits Godrich Gardee’s family in Mbombela: Police investigate murder of Gardee’s daughter:
