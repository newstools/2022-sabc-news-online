Motorists in Tanzania have seen a further spike in fuel prices, which have hit a new record high according to the latest price list released by the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority. The prices for petrol, diesel, and Kerosene per liter are now the highest in the country’s history. With petrol at $1.51 and diesel priced at $1.52 Motorists in Tanzania face an increase of 9.5 percent for petrol and 17.1 percent for diesel, compared to prices last month. Officials from the energy and water utilities regulatory Authority say the increased prices are due to increases in import and transport costs, and the crisis in Ukraine. They also say fuel prices in the country are comparable to those in neighboring countries. The new retail prices were set by the government as wholesale prices for petrol and diesel shipments offloaded at Tanzania’s main ports went past the $1.3 per liter mark for the first time in April. Last week President Samia Suluhu Hassan told Tanzanians to prepare for tougher times ahead as far as fuel prices are concerned. The President then ordered the reinstatement of the 40 cents on fuel that was initially scrapped as a measure to cushion the impact of the high fuel prices on citizens. But she now says the burden can not be carried by the government alone. -Reporting by Daniel Kijo SABC from Dar es Salaam
