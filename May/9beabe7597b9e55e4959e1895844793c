The Northern Cape police have apprehended 15 suspects wanted for various crimes in Kimberley. They were charged with assault, theft, housebreaking, and violating a protection order, among other offences. Police spokesperson, Timothy Sam says the suspects will appear in the Kimberley Magistrate’s Court soon. ” A team of Roodepan police station detectives led by Christopher Mashodi embarked on a wanted suspect tracing operation. The suspects have been evading court appearance dates and other violated court orders. The suspects were arrested at their respective residences in and around Roodepan.” Meanwhile, the Kimberley Regional Court has sentenced a 36-year-old man to life in prison for raping an 80-year-old woman. Sizwe Ntwane was slapped with a life sentence for rape, assault and housebreaking. According to evidence presented in court, the convicted rapist slept overnight at the victim’s home following the rape. A niece of the elderly woman said they are hoping that the life sentence will serve as a deterrent for rape. “Every person that rapes a person deserves a life sentence. Ever since then, she is not feeling too well. She is on painkillers and ointment for the legs. Sometimes she just shut down, not speaking.”
