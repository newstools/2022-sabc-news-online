The family of the late former Springbok captain and Cabinet Minister, Dawie de Villiers, say he will be remembered for the values he instilled in them. Family and friends of De Villiers have paid tribute to him during his memorial service at the Moederkerk in Stellenbosch. De Villiers died at his home in Stellenbosch last week from natural causes at the age of 81. He played 25 tests for the Springboks and later became a member of parliament. His son, Coenie de Villiers, paid tribute to his father during the service. He says, “We will remember all the values that he taught us to exercise, to read widely, to travel, he had a love for sport so all of us had a healthy lifestyle and we’ll remember him for those values he instilled in us.” VIDEO: SA Rugby confirms the death of former Springbok captain, Dawie de Villiers:
