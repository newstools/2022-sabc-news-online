The common assault case against Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema and party MP, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi has been postponed to June 3. The postponement was requested by the defence in preparation for their Section 179 discharge application. The state’s last witness in the case, Major General, Nonhlanhla Zulu failed to appear – allegedly due to ill health. Magistrate Leiland Poonsamy dismissed the application by the state for another postponement to have Zulu testify.

Poonsamy gives this ruling: “There was an arrangement for the witness to be present in court today. They have consulted, and they were ready to proceed with further evidence, calling the witness to testify before the court, to have the matter concluded today. The witness has not indicated to them [about] any medical conditions. The court finds it very suspicious that … the court finds that the two accused before the court have been prejudiced in the completion of their trial in this regard.” Below is the live stream of today’s court proceedings:  Staff Sergeant at the Johannesburg Military Police, Moleleki Mapisa, has testified that Malema and Ndlozi pushed Lieutenant Colonel Johannes Venter in 2018. Video footage played in court shows Mapisa intervened by trying to restrain Ndlozi. Venter previously testified that Malema and Ndlozi had pushed him at the entrance of the Fourways Memorial Park.
