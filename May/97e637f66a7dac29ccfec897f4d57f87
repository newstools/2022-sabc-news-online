The community of the Mpola area near Mariannhill, west of Durban, has built a temporary bridge over a river after the recent floods washed away a concrete pedestrian bridge. They used tree trunks and planks to make the makeshift bridge.

As parents, we were forced to wake up early in the morning and come to this river to carry the kids across the river. We did the same thing in the afternoon when kids were coming back from school. That is how an idea of a temporary bridge structure came about,” says Mhlongo. Dbn khalesakhe mbhense/whatsapp: dries 04.05.2022 ed: nosizwe
