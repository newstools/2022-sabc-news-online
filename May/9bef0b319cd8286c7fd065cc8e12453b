Whatever happens would be quite unfortunate but we always advise people that they need to act with caution. As far as we have been told the members of the security cluster everything is in place. The event has been categorised as medium risk because we have international guests and high level people. But we don’t foresee any major problems.” The #WorldofWorkShow will be back on Monday! The new episode focuses on the 5th Global Conference on the Elimination of Child Labour, hosted by  from 15 to 20 May. Join our guests live from Durban! 16 May
