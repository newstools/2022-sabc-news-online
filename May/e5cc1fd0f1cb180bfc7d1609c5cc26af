The South African Democratic Teachers’ Union (Sadtu) in the Free State has expressed concerns over the shortage of foundation phase teachers in the province. The union says recruiting more education assistants can ease the challenge. Earlier this year, parents at Matla primary school in Bloemfontein prevented their children from attending school after they demanded the recruitment of more teachers. Sadtu provincial secretary, Mokholoane Moloi says the foundation phase is critical. “Introduction of education assistants, which we believe will add more value, because when you reduce the number of learners in the classes it automatically translates into more educators. The department will have to employ more educators and we believe that assistant educators, if they can be full-time employed, will add value as support staff to educators. And that is the matter that we will take forward as the organization,” says Moloi.
