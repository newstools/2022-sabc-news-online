Eskom says Stage 2 of rolling blackouts will once again be implemented from 17:00 until 22:00 Tuesday, with the possibility of higher stages should any breakdowns occur during the day. It says evening peak supply constraints continue to persist and the onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to severe capacity constraints throughout the period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. “Tonight Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented between 17:00 and 22:00, with the possibility of higher stages should any further generation unit breakdowns occur before then. A generation unit each at the Kusile and Arnot power stations is expected to return to service this afternoon. Since yesterday evening, a unit each at Arnot, Grootvlei and Matla power stations either tripped or were taken offline for repairs. At the same time two units were returned to service; one each at Kriel and Grootvlei power stations,” says spokesperson, Sikhonathi Mantshantsha. South Africans have been urged to use electricity sparingly. #POWERALERT1 With evening peak supply constraints persisting, Stage 2 loadshedding will again be implemented from 17:00 – 22:00 tonight, with the possibility of higher stages should any breakdowns occur during the day pic.twitter.com/b2ExoCzP1u — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) May 10, 2022
