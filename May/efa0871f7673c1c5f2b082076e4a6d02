Advocate Malesela Teffo says his own legal battles will not impact the Senzo Meyiwa murder trial. The defence lawyer returned to the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court on Friday morning after his arrest last month on contempt of court charges. Teffo is representing four of the accused in the Meyiwa trial that began last month. When the trial was postponed, he found himself cuffed and in the court cells. The policeman-turned-advocate was arrested for contempt of court for failing to appear twice. He is facing charges of trespassing and common assault. His legal counsel brought an application for the magistrate to recuse himself from the process The Magistrate postponed the matter to hear the application. As the Senzo Meyiwa trial returns to The Pretoria High Court on Monday, Teffo says, “I am ready for Monday, we will continue and still be representing the four accused.” Teffo’s case has now being postponed to July 8 at the Hillbrow Magistrate’s Court.
