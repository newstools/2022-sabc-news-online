Markets in the Indian capital, northern Aligarh, Lucknow, and Moradabad cities were buzzing with activity as men and women, with children shopped for food items, clothes and jewellery. A grand celebration of the festival is being held this time after coronavirus forced people to have muted celebrations in the past two years. “By God’s will, the business is going good. Our shops were closed in the last two years (due to coronavirus), people did not come for two years as they were locked down but now it is the auspicious time so people are feeling relieved,” said a shopkeeper, Sherazuddin. However, for many, the prices of commodities have gone up and buyers have slashed their spending. During Ramadan, Muslims abstain from eating and drinking during daylight hours for about 30 days. At the end of the fasting month, people celebrate a religious holiday, Eid ul-Fitr. The day begins with early morning prayers and then family visits and feasts, often featuring a lavish spread of traditional delicacies.
