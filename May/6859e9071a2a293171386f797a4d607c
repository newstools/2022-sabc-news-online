KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane says her department will use some of its budget towards repairing damages caused by last month’s floods. She was delivering the department’s R49 billion budget in Pietermaritzburg. The damage to health facilities is estimated at over R200 million. The budget saw a reduction from R50 billion in the previous financial year to R49 billion during the 2022/2023 fiscal. Simelane says the department will also buy some more medical equipment. “As the response to the floods and the damage caused to our facilities we have to re-prioritize certain projects as advised by the treasury. As a result, we took a decision that planned maintenance and capital projects that have not reached the tender stage will have to be halted. The funds originally allocated will be re-prioritized and re-directed towards repairing the damage caused by the storm to our infrastructure. This is due to the fact that the national treasury has not allocated funding for these repairs at this stage,” explains Simelane. The province is still reeling from the worst floods to hit the country in 60 years, which killed over 400 people.
Many of the thousands of people who were displaced were forced to seek refuge in community halls and local churches.
