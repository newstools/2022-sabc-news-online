African National Congress (ANC) branch members in the Free State’s Mangaung Region say they need to hold branch general meetings to rebuild their structures. This is the build-up to the provincial elective conference, which is scheduled for June. The ANC Women’s League and ANC Youth League structures marched to the ANC provincial office where they handed over a list of grievances regarding the running of the party in the province. They are accusing the Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) of overstaying their welcome.
