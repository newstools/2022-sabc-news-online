Hong Kong’s leader-in-waiting, John Lee, was endorsed for the city’s top job on Sunday (May 8) by a committee stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists, as the financial hub attempts to relaunch itself after several years of political upheaval. Lee, the sole candidate, received the votes of 1,416 members of a pro-Beijing election committee on Sunday morning, granting him the majority required to anoint him as Hong Kong’s next leader. Eight voted to “not support” him. Speaking afterwards, Lee said it was his “historic mission” to lead a new chapter for Hong Kong, while pledging to unite the city and preserve Hong Kong’s international status as an open, and more competitive financial hub bridging China and the world. Few of the city’s 7.4 million people have any say in choosing their leader, despite China’s promises to one day grant full democracy to the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Hong Kong residents have mixed feelings as new leader is elected Hong Kong’s sole candidate for the next Chief Executive, John Lee, was endorsed by a committee stacked with pro-Beijing loyalists on Sunday and local residents had mixed feelings about their next leader. One local resident, surnamed Kwok, said she had modest expectations for the new administration, but hoped they would be able to improve the economy and help people facing economic difficulties. Another resident, surnamed Ho, was pleased to learn Lee had been chosen as the former British colony’s new leader by over 90% percent of the election committee and congratulated him. Lee, a former Hong Kong secretary for security, has forcefully implemented China’s harsher regime under a national security law and is due to take over from incumbent Carrie Lam on July 1.
