Four people charged for allegedly murdering a man in 2006 will appear at the Seshego Magistrate’s Court in Polokwane, in Limpopo on Wednesday. The three businessmen and a woman allegedly killed Ronnie Makgato for ritual purposes. They were arrested last month after the so-called Polokwane serial killer, Themba Dube implicated them in Makgato’s killing. Dube was arrested last year for allegedly killing seven women in Polokwane. Makgato’s remains have not yet been found. The businessmen, Marcus Makgato of Makgato Lodge, Joshua Hlako of Hlako Mohafe Tour Bus services, Khumbelo Mabirimisa of Mabirimisa Bus Services, and their co-accused, Amanda Makgato have been charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder. They allegedly killed Ronnie Makgato for ritual-related purposes in 2006. Makgato was reported missing in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria. The lawyer for the four accused, former National Prosecuting Authority head Mokotedi Mpshe, previously told the court that remanding his clients in custody would be trampling on their constitutional rights.
