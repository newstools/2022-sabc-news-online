Hawks spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Philani Nkwalase says, “The goods worth a combined value of R500 000 were seized and transported to the designated counterfeit goods depot pending the finalization of the criminal and civil cases against the suspects. The suspected duo aged 25 and 29 will at the later stage be served with J175 summons to appear in court for contravention of the counterfeit goods Act.” Earlier this week, Parliament’s Standing Committee on Finance expressed concern about the deluge of counterfeit goods into the country saying this threatens the economy. As a result, the committee said it will embark on an oversight visit to three major ports of entry. The committee will visit OR Tambo International Airport, Beitbridge border and the Durban Harbour to conduct an inspection of the South African Revenue Service (SARS)’s custom duties.
