Residents in Siloam and Tshikombani, outside Louis Trichardt in Limpopo, have expressed concern about the prevalence of ATM fraud incidents in the area. This comes after several people were duped by ATM scammers. Police suspect that a gang of robbers could be operating in the area. One of the victims, 62-year-old Victoria Mulafhi is a teacher by profession.  She lost nearly R10 000 due to ATM fraud. Mulafhi says she has reported the matter to the police but has not found any relief. “I have made endless calls to the police regarding my case. I have been calling every day to make a follow-up about my case. My heart is in pain. I haven’t received any help from the police.” Limpopo Police Spokesperson Motlafela Mojapelo has confirmed that several cases of ATM fraud have been opened in the area. “We can confirm that several crimes perpetrated at or involving ATMs are being investigated by the police. This is after some victims reported that their monies were stolen from their accounts after using ATMs. The recent case involves a woman who was allegedly defrauded more than R10 000 after using an ATM in the Vhembe District. No one has been arrested and police investigations are continuing,” says Mojapelo. Meanwhile, at the start of the festive season last year, Northern Cape police urged residents to be vigilant when using ATMs. Police in the area reported increases in cases of ATM fraud, where criminals would target the most vulnerable victims.
