A Limpopo parolee is using his vegetable farming skills to earn a living and to help him to re-integrate into the community. Ands Magai from Mathabatha village outside Lebowakgomu was released on parole by the Department of Correctional Services after spending almost seven years in prison for murdering his girlfriend. Magai says he would not let his criminal record chain him to the rungs of poverty. He sells his produce to residents of his community and a local supermarket. “I started doing this in 2017. I planted tomatoes and they came out well. I did it again in 2018, I planted watermelons and beetroot – all those came out nicely no problems. I realised this was my opportunity. I realised I could take this opportunity and carry on this went on and now everything is just like this,” says Magai. Magai’s mother, Francinah, says she’s pleased to see her son doing something constructive. “I gave the land because he had nothing to do. He started ploughing and then harvesting and everything just fell into place,” says Francinah.
