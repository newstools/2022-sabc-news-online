The election results of the 9th African National Congress (ANC) Eastern Cape provincial conference will be announced later on Monday with party President Cyril Ramaphosa expected to close it in the evening. Several ANC bigwigs in the province including Premier Oscar Mabuyane, businessman Babalo Madikizela and Nelson Mandela Bay ANC member Andile Lungisa are vying for the top five positions. Lungisa was the only candidate for the position of treasurer in the Madikizela’s slate. But other names contending for his position came from the floor with Zolile Williams being nominated by 25% of the delegates to square up with him. The video below is reporting on proceedings at ANC conference:  Meanwhile, Mlibo Qoboshiyane has defended his decision to withdraw his candidacy for the position of chairperson of the ANC in the Eastern Cape. Qoboshiyane announced that he is supporting Babalo Madikizela for the position. Delegates at the ninth ANC Provincial Conference in East London have been at loggerheads over credentials and this has delayed the conclusion of the three-day gathering. ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa has been forced to postpone his closing address from Sunday to Monday. Qoboshiyane says his decision to join Madikizela is based on their common interests and not on personal gain. “I indicated to comrades that they must not worry to be in any [position] of the top 5, that is not in my interest. Anything that may happen in the reconfiguration must not be a determinant for me to serve this province. I said to them, my availability is to serve people of his province, since [when I was still in the] youth league till to date. In which position, [will I serve] that’s not my preoccupation. I’m available to serve Eastern Cape collectively,” explains Qoboshiyane. -Additional reporting by Lubabalo Dada. The video below is Sunday media briefing of the conference:
