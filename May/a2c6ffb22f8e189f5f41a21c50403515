Pernille Harder scored from the spot as Chelsea moved a step closer to retaining their Women’s Super League title with a 1-0 win over bottom side Birmingham City, restoring their four-point lead after Arsenal thrashed Aston Villa 7-0 earlier on Sunday. Birmingham defended bravely until the 71st minute when they were penalised for handball, and Danish striker Harder rolled home the spot kick to claim the three points. A win at home to Manchester United in their final game of the season next Sunday will see Chelsea secure their third league title in a row. Earlier in the day, Vivianne Miedema scored a pair of pile-drivers and Nikita Parris netted her 50th Women’s Super League goal from the penalty spot as second-placed Arsenal hammered Villa to keep up the pressure on Chelsea. Second-placed Arsenal, who are on 49 points, face Tottenham Hotspur in midweek before finishing their league campaign away to West Ham. Earlier in the day, Manchester United cruised to a 3-0 win over West Ham United to climb back into third place above Manchester City, who thumped Brighton & Hove Albion 7-2 on Saturday. At the bottom of the table, Leicester grabbed a 0-0 draw with Reading for what may prove to be a vital point in the battle against relegation. The Foxes are on 13 points after 21 games, five ahead of Birmingham, who have a game in hand against Manchester City in midweek before rounding off against Aston Villa on the final day of the season.
