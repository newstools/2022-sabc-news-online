The Bisho High Court in the Eastern Cape has refused the application for separation of trial in the Mandela Fraud Scandal case.  The application was lodged by accused number one, Phumlani Mkolo. Mkolo has previously filed a number of applications in this case, including one seeking the recusal of presiding judge Igna Stretch, which was also denied. The case has seen several delays that have been preventing the start of the trial. The accused include former Buffalo City Speaker Luleka Simon-Ndzele, former Mayor Zukiswa Ncitha, and former Deputy Mayor Themba Tinta, former Eastern Cape Health MEC Sindiswa Gomba and the Municipality’s former Supply Chain Manager, Thembelani Sali. They are charged with fraud, money laundering and the contravention of the Municipal Finance Management Act relating to the memorial services of former president Nelson Mandela. Hawks arrest 9 suspects on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering
