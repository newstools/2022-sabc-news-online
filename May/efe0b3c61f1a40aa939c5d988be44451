Western Cape Minister of Police Oversight and Community Safety, Reagen Allen, says they will be reintroducing the reward system for the anonymous reporting of illegal firearms. Allen was speaking following a visit to Manenberg and Heideveld where there has been a flare-up in gang shootings. The police’s Anti-Gang Unit and other services have been deployed to the areas to monitor the volatile situation. Allen says the current situation is unacceptable. To further combat the shootings that are occurring, we’ll be reintroducing our rewards system for the anonymous reporting of where illegal firearms can be found. Further details about the rewards system & how to report the whereabouts of an illegal firearm will be communicated. — Reagen Allen (@ReagenAllen) May 21, 2022
