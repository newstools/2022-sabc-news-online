The University of Mpumalanga has cancelled three accredited student accommodation facilities belonging to murder suspect, Philemon Lukhele. Lukhele and two other suspects are facing six charges including kidnapping, rape, murder, firearms and ammunition, defeating the ends of justice and conspiracy to commit murder. They are accused of killing Hillary Gardee the daughter of former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Secretary-General Godrich Gardee. Student Dean at the University of Mpumalanga, Dr Paul Maminza says the 64 students who were accommodated at Lukhele’s facilities have been moved to other accredited facilities. “Now our students’ housing has engaged with other facilities that are accredited by the university to establish where space [is] still available and we are pleased that those facilities cooperated with student housing, We provided students with [a] list of those facilities and that process has started. Students are moving to the other accredited facilities. I must indicate that the university has taken this decision because we care about the safety and well being of our students,” says Maminza s VIDEO: Suspects in Hillary Gardee murder case to appear in court:
