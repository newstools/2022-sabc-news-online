Bus services in the City of Tshwane remain suspended due to a strike by South African Municipal Workers’ Union (Samwu) affiliated bus drivers, while the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) members will be on strike at Extremetec, an agency responsible for fare collection services for the Areyeng BRT bus system in the city. They are demanding a transport allowance of R2500 and a nightshift allowance of R60 per hour. Workers are planning to march to the City on Friday over the issue. Numsa Spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola says, “Workers at Extremetec have to arrive at work at 4 AM, they knock off at 9pm, and there is no reliable transport available at that time. Workers spend a fortune paying for transport in order to make it to and from work.” “Our members are demanding a transport allowance of R2500 and a nightshift allowance of R60 per hour. The issue of transport allowance is a burning issue for workers at Tshwane Rapid Transit (TRT) and for workers at Tshwane Affected Operation Investment (TAOI). All these agencies fall under Areyeng and provide services.” NUMSA members at #Extremetec are going on strike starting Wednesday 11 May. #Extremetec is an agency for the City of Tshwane BRT bus service. #ExtremetecStrike
