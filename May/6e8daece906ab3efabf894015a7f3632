Parents at Hluvukani Primary School, in Xanthia village east of Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga, are calling for the Education Department to build a new school in the village. This follows the burning of several classrooms at the school early this week. In 2012, one of the school blocks had its roof blown off by a storm and the provincial government committed to building a new school. As a temporary solution, the department provided mobile classrooms. Two months ago, parents decided to shut down the school claiming that their children are not safe. Chairperson of the School Governing Body, Marrey Mashego says they don’t know what caused the fire at the school. Mashego says the community has been complaining for a long time and they hope for a speedily intervention from the Education Department. “They were complaining since 2012 during disaster. On the 7th of March this year , the community decided to close the school, we informed the government some of the officials they came here and see what had happened . We’re just waiting that they build us a school. As I’m saying, it happened in 2012,” says Mashego. Mashego says they  reported the issue in 2012. “Up until today, the school is not yet build,” adds Mashego. VIDEO: Parents of Hluvukani Primary fear for their children’s safety [ 14 August 2015]
