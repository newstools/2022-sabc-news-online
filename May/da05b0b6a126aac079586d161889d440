Robbers have made off with more than 30 computers following a break in at the City of Tshwane’s driving and vehicle licensing station in Centurion, Pretoria, last night. Police are investigating. This has forced the city to suspend some of the crucial services to the public. The city’s spokesperson Lindela Mashigo,”The following services are suspended until further notice. Driving license renewals, registration and licensing of motor vehicles. The centre will continue to render services for application and testing for driver and learner licenses. We urge residents to make use of our other centres which is Waterloo, Akasia and Bronkhortspruit.”
