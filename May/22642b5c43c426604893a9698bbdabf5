Wheelchair-bound and Kariega born bodybuilding star, Max Kulati from the Eastern Cape has been selected to represent South Africa at the Slovenia Body-Building World Cup in June. This is the biggest international competition of this sporting code and hosts the best of the best from all over the world. This 33-year old, from an impoverished background, has to fund his own way to this prestigious tournament. Kulati says the International Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation does not receive funding from the government, due to the federation not meeting requirements for funding. Ultimately, he has to roll himself around town, looking for sponsors and investors to help make his dream come true. Kulati says, “It’s quite disappointing because I won’t just be representing South Africa but the entire African continent because that’s an international world cup, and the government even the councillors can’t help me. Fortunately, I have this team max 2022, they are the guys who are helping me. Even some of the guys working at metro gym and the guys from the community they are helping me out.” The trip and competition fees accumulate to R 50 000. The International Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation does not receive funding from the government, due to the federation not meeting requirements for funding, they cannot help Max on his journey. IBFF’s spokesperson Rochelle Van der Bank says, ” IBFF does not receive any funding from the government and relies solely on investors and sponsors. We ask investors and sponsors to promote the sport of body building especially in the rural areas. There are so many athletes with enormous talent but they lack the funds.” The Department of Sport says they have a multi-million rand budget that covers over 60 federations who meet their funding requirements. Although Kulati says his training and preparation is coming along nicely, he is still very concerned about his visa application.
