Sinenhlanhla Hlope was one of nine family members at home in KaCutshwayo, when mudslides collapsed and washed away their home. The body of just one family member, her mother, has been found. She says seven of her loved ones remain missing, among them, her one-year-old son. “There are eight members from our family who were washed away by floods, we believe they are late, we found our mother at the Desai River few kilometres away from here, dead. We have buried her, but the other seven people are still missing,” says Hlope. Hlope called on those tasked to search for the missing people not to give up. “We will only get closure by at least burying our loved ones,”says Hlope.
