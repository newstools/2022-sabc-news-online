Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and his colleague at Finance, Enoch Godongwana have dismissed reports of a conflict between their departments regarding the sale of a majority stake in South African Airways to the Takatso Consortium. The two ministers have told SCOPA that they are satisfied that the responsibility to acquire a strategic equity partner rests with Public Enterprises which is the representative of government as the shareholder. National Treasury Director-General Dondo Mogajane had previously expressed concern about not being updated on the process of the sale. Gordhan says he and Godongwana have now agreed that a proper process was followed. He says, “The minister of finance has also indicated that these are cabinet decisions being implemented. All the necessary work is being pursued in terms of that mandate. The will be healthy exchange and debate because no two lawyers will agree on these complex matters but once there is sufficient room for clarity you can get alignment which we currently have.” VIDEO: Government announces Takatso Consortium as strategic equity partner for SAA:
