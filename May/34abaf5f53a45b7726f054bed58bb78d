During an official visit to El Salvador on Friday, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador urged the U.S. to cooperate with Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico to help solve the current migration crisis that is hitting the region. His Salvadoran counterpart Nayib Bukele said he agreed with the proposal, we can all create a plan together where we all can pitch in, depending on our economies of course, to be able to solve a joint problem which affects us all.” Both presidents stressed how important it was to improve the situation in Central American countries so as to motivate people to stay home and not migrate. Challenges are related to the fight against poverty, inequality, unemployment and marginalization. Those are the deep roots of insecurity, of migration and other misfortunes, said Lopez Obrador. Every year, thousands of Central Americans embark on a long and dangerous journey fleeing poverty, violence, and corruption at home to the United States in search of the American dream. However, many are victims of the dangers of the route. Lopez Obrador’s tour will continue to Honduras and Belize and end in Cuba on Sunday
