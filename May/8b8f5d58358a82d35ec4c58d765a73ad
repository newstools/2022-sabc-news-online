Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Defence will call the chiefs of the various services of the Defence Force to appear before it soon to explain what disciplinary measures they have taken against staff found guilty of fraud and corruption. According to a presentation, by the department of defence, 56 uniformed members are currently on suspension for fraud and corruption to the tune of R30 million. Committee chairperson Cyril Xaba says once they have met the service chiefs, they will call the Chief of the Defence Force General Rudzani Maphwanya to explain what he has done. Maphwanya says, “Before we go to the chief we thought we should have a discussion with the Chiefs of the services because it is to them that the report has been given. And when the matter has been referred to the Chief of the SANDF, then only the Chief can give us the status report on matters because they have moved from the chiefs of service or division to him for action and if there is no action then the chief himself must be held accountable.”
