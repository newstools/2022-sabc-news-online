The Life Esidimeni Inquest has been delayed once again due to unavailability of witnesses. The high court in Pretoria has rescheduled the proceedings for  Wednesday. On Monday,  hearings were also adjourned after one of the witnesses asked to be excused from giving evidence. However, the request was rejected. The court has since advised the legal representative of the witness in question to file a formal application of objection. 1044 patients died of hunger, dehydration and neglect after being moved to ill-equipped NGOs.
