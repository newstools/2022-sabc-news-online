President Cyril Ramaphosa has participated in the African Union’s 16th extraordinary summit in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Today the focus of the summit is on the challenges of removal of governments by force and acts of terror on the continent. African Union Chairperson, Moussa Faki Mahamat says terrorism in the continent needs to be rooted out. “Africa is the last continent in the world to experience such high levels of terrorism and unconstitutional government changes. We should take up this challenge and overcome it at the continental level,” says Mahamat. It is also the first opportunity for African leaders since 2014 to address collective defence and security in the face of terrorism and violent extremism currently affecting all five regions of the African Union. pic.twitter.com/aq7Sk94wHO — Presidency | South Africa  (@PresidencyZA) May 28, 2022  The UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Counter-Terrorism, Vladimir Voronkov, claims it has jeopardised the continent’s stability. “Terrorism remains a significant global threat affecting the lives of millions of people. This has been felt particularly in the five regions of Africa where terrorist activities have regrettably increased. Approximately half of the deaths attributed to terrorism globally last year were recorded in the continent.”
