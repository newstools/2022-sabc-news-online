The Department of Health in KwaZulu-Natal has expressed concern about the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the province, with more than 1 700 cases reported in the last 24 hours. The province says it’s the first time in many months that new infections threatened to reach the 2 000 mark. The Provincial Health MEC, Nomagugu Simelane, says the number of hospitalisations was also of concern. Of the 437 people currently admitted to hospital, 47 were in ICU and 9 were on ventilators. Simelane says the 20%  increase in cases over seven-day moving average points to a resurgence. The department has urged people to stay alert and adhere to COVID-19 protocols, such as wearing face masks, maintaining social distancing and washing hands. It’s also pleaded with people in the province to get vaccinated. Over 2.7 million people are fully vaccinated in the province. It’s believed that 4.4 million people in the province have not yet received a single jab.
