Nelson Mandela Bay African National Congress member Andile Lungisa, who is vying for the treasurer position on Babalo Madikizela’s slate, has told delegates that his grouping would object to adopting credentials. The group feels strongly that branches with what he considers to be ‘questionable status’ should be excluded from participating at the conference. They took the matter to court on Saturday night, but it was struck off the roll by the Eastern Cape High Court in East London. The three day conference was initially planned to end on Sunday evening, but there has been delays with the verification process for credentials of delegates attending the conference. Lungisa says he’s been cleared to participate in the conference following his prior conviction… “I do not have any issue, you must remember charges were meted against me, through the internal DC of the ANC, I was cleared by that DC, of the ANC nationally. I’m a cleared person, by the internal DC of the ANC, if you don’t like my face or you don’t like my looks, it’s not really my problem.” ANC Eastern Cape conference I Andile Lungiswa speaks out Ramaphosa to close the Eastern Cape ANC elective conference on Monday The 9th Eastern Cape ANC Elective Conference had been extended by yet another day, as ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa, is expected to speak on Monday, closing the gathering.
