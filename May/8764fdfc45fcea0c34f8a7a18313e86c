Two ANC members in the Nelson Mandela Bay region of the Eastern Cape have been shot dead at Kariega. 45-year-old ward councillor Andile Andries and 41-year-old branch Secretary Lubabalo Keso were gunned down outside of a house in KwaNobuhle. It is alleged that a minibus taxi drove towards them and the suspects fired several shots before fleeing. The incident comes after a spate of attacks on ANC members in the region in the last few months. It also happens as the party prepares to hold its ninth Provincial Elective Conference this weekend. ANC Nelson Mandela Bay regional secretary Luyolo Nqakula, Well, we are shocked and traumatised as the African National Congress that two of our comrades were brutally gunned down. The reasons behind this heinous crime are unknown at this stage, but we are calling on law enforcement agencies to dispense of all investigations with a matter of urgency so arrests can be made. We extend our condolences to the two families of comrade Andries and comrade Keso.”
