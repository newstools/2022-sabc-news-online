Parliament’s Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) says it wants action to be taken against management of the Road Accident Fund, for changing its accounting system when auditing its financial statement for 2020-2021 financial year. The office of the Auditor General (AG) told Parliament that despite warning the Accounting Officer and management of the RAF that the system they used was not the correct method, the entity ignored the advice. The AG says this has resulted in the RAF receiving an audit opinion of a disclaimer and an irregular expenditure to the tune of R 90 million due to the non-compliance with the Act.
