KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says the Department of Home Affairs in the province is working to assist people – whose identity documents were lost or damaged in the recent flood disaster. Over 400 people are known to have died as a result of last month’s stormy conditions. The Premier says citizens can request that the home affairs department assist them in obtaining ID documents and birth certificates. “We have been working with home affairs to ensure that all of those people who got affected by floods are assisted to get their birth certificates and IDs and all other required documents from Home Affairs. We are grateful for the support we have received from national government but also from NGOs to support various communities that are affected by floods,” adds Zikalala. Below is the full interview with Sihle Zikalala:  Three weeks ago, devastating floods left a trail of destruction, largely in areas in and around Durban. Last month, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) Minister Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma urged KwaZulu-Natal municipalities to speed up aid to communities affected by recent floods. Dlamini-Zuma conducted an oversight visit to the Provincial Disaster Management Centre in Pietermaritzburg.
