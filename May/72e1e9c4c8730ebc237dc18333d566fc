The African National Congress in Johannesburg and Ekurhuleni regions will not convene conferences at the weekend. The party’s provincial executive committee in Gauteng has instructed the structures to solve and finalise all outstanding disputes before they sit. All five regions in the province are gearing up to hold conferences ahead of the hotly contested provincial conference in June. Former regional secretary, Dada Morero is going head to head with former Johannesburg mayor and regional treasurer, Mpho Moerane for the position of chairperson. In 2021, the party dipped to 33-point-six percent and lost the Johannesburg metro to a multiparty coalition. If elected Morero says the party in the region must prioritise mending relations between the ANC and the people. “We are a national organisation, a unitary organisation and our responsibility is to begin to deal with that trust deficit between ourselves and communities and largely refers to those that have publicly done wrong and they’re known that they have been charged by the courts and I think the public is more concerned about the speed at which we deal with such individuals.” Working hard to improve management of its credentials The Eastern Cape 9th ANC Provincial conference nearly hit a snag after delegates disagreed over the adoption of credentials. They were arguing over the inclusion of ten branches from the Dr WB Rubusana region who failed meet the requirements to participate in the conference. They also had an issue with the inclusion of delegates from the veterans league saying the veterans have no viable structure in the province. In 2017, the provincial descended into chaos when delegates also failed to agree on the credentials. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said they are trying to be thorough when dealing with credentials.
