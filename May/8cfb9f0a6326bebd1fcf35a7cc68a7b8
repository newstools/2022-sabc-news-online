The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has described the killing of two of its members in the Nelson Mandela Bay Region as a barbaric act. Ward 43 councillor in Nelson Mandela Bay, Andile Andries and branch secretary Lubabalo Kesa were gunned down outside Andries’ home on Monday. The killings happened just a few days before the much anticipated ANC Provincial Elective Conference (PEC). The party has rejected claims that the killing of Andries and Kesa could be linked to the conference. Nelson Mandela Bay Regional secretary, Luyolo Nqakula says, “In as much as we can’t speculate from our view point, what has happened is a pure act of criminality. It is a barbaric act. It can not be associated with the ANC. That is why we are calling for the expediating of all investigations and lead to culmination to the arrest of individuals, not only arrest but prosecuting of individuals.” The video below is the full interview with ANC Eastern Cape Head of Communications, Gift Ngqondi:
