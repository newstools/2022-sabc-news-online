Defence lawyers for accused one to four in the murder trial of former Orlando Pirates and Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa want Ten 10 Films, a company producing a documentary for streaming service Netflix, to be barred from attending proceedings. The trial resumed more than an hour and a half late on Monday as legal representatives were locked in the judge’s chambers over the matter. Five men are on trial for the premeditated murder of the soccer icon who was gunned down at the home of his girlfriend’s mother Kelly Khumalo almost eight years ago. Defence advocate Malesela Teffo has accused the company of exposing potential witnesses to intimidation after the Senzo Meyiwa documentary was flighted on Netflix four days before the trial kicked off. “It was after my potential clients for witness 1-4 companies that we have been exposed to the harassment, to the intimidation. It is common cause that this court knows that we have been harassed, starting with me.” The judge in the matter asked for a 10 minute adjournment to apply his mind on the Ten 10 films – Netflix arguments.
