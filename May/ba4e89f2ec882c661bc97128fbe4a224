Exactly a year ago, Prudence Sekgodiso won the women’s 800m title on Day 3 of the Athletics South Africa Senior Track and Field Championships in Tshwane. At the age of 19-years-old, she finished in a time of 2-8.35 seconds. Fast forward to a year later, the now 20 year old ran the race of her life to smash her personal best in the 800M race to clinch victory in the third edition of the KipKeino Classic. Sekgodiso ran a blistering 1-58.41 seconds  in the process beating world champion Halimah Nakaayi at the KipKeino Classic in Kenya.
