Travel exhibitors who are showcasing their diverse tourism products and services at this year’s Travel Indaba in Durban say they are optimistic it will help them to renew old relationships and establish new networks. The tourism sector suffered a double blow due to the COVID-19 pandemic and last July’s civil unrest. The recent floods have been yet another setback for the industry. It’s brought together over 200 international buyers. One of the exhibitors, Kudzai Mqingwana of Babanango Game Reserve says their business was just a year old when the pandemic started. “We are newcomers in the game, we are also newcomers into this Tourism Indaba site. We are looking forward to the growth and return of guests into the region. I think we want to encourage people to come out and to experience the beautiful countryside, Zululand.  We really would like to say that we have been COVID safe and people are COVID complaint. the way that we are managing guests and managing visitors in the area is to bring people to experience these spaces,” says Mqingwana.
