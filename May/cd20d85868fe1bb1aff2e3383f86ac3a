Billionaire Elon Musk made clear on Thursday that even though he wants Twitter to lift its permanent ban on former President Donald Trump, that doesn’t mean he supports Trump in a prospective 2024 presidential campaign. Musk, the world’s richest person and CEO of Tesla, is attempting to close a deal to acquire Twitter. Musk told a Financial Times conference on Tuesday that Twitter’s decision to ban Trump was “morally bad.” He followed up on those remarks in a tweet on Thursday evening, stressing he does not back Trump as a presidential candidate. “Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter,” he said.
