Ethiopian state-appointed human rights body has called for the release of 16 journalists and media personnel after new arrests were made recently in the capital of Addis Ababa and the restive region of Amhara. Press watchdogs and rights groups say Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government is increasingly intimidating the media and harassing opponents as it seeks to quell unrest in regions. Ethiopian authorities have been cracking down in Amhara and Oromiya regions recently, accusing media personnel of siding with rebels. The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission says, Temesgen Desalegn of Feteh Magazine and Yayesew Shimelis of Ethio Forum Media were held on Thursday in Addis Ababa. Last week, Amhara authorities arrested five journalists of media outlet Ashara in a move thought linked to their coverage of a volunteer militia known as Fano. Amhara authorities also arrested four other US-based online outlet Nisir International Broadcasting employees n the same day. Rights commission head Daniel Bekele said the total number of detained journalists was now 16 and urged their immediate release. “No claim about the alleged offence committed through media justifies violation of the newly adopted media law which clearly prohibits pre-trial detention of persons charged with committing an offence through the media.”, Bekele said in a statement. Government spokesperson Legesse Tulu did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Bekele’s statement. The government did however put out a warning to the media in a statement last week saying they will continue to take irreversible measures on individuals involved in illegal activities and those who are planning and working on causing chaos, those wearing a cloak of media outlets and journalists included.
