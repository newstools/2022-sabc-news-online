Beneficiaries of a successful land claim at various Magoebaskloof farms in Limpopo say they have not received any payment since the land was returned to them in 2004. A total of 42 farms were returned to about 600 beneficiaries by the Department of Land Reform. Thirty-nine farms were leased to a well known company that farms fresh produce for the export market. The beneficiaries say the farm tenants have been paying rent, but directors of Makgoba Assets Management Trust have not distributed the money to them. Magoro Letsoalo and Fridah Mathole are some of the beneficiaries. “We are suffering; we wanted those farms to feed us and take care of our children and take them to school. If the government was really taking care of us, by ensuring that we get our benefits we wouldn’t be applying for Sassa grants and RDP houses. My husband is now deceased without receiving his money. The elders are also dying without reaping their benefits and we don’t know what is happening. We need help.” Meanwhile, Makgoba Assets Management Trust Chairperson, Thupane Makgoba, says he will only comment on the matter after meeting with the complainants in the coming weeks, to resolve their issue.
