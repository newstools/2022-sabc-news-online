The United Nations says the number of people who do not have enough food has risen to over 190 million in 53 countries around the world. The 2022 Global Report on Food Crises indicates that the most vulnerable people are found in countries experiencing conflicts like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Syria. 2022 Global Report on Food Crises shows hunger crisis is worsening:  The number of hungry people globally increased by 40 million last year, according to a report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme. Researchers attribute the growth in hunger to insecurity and conflict in most of the countries reviewed. The report also highlights the COVID-19 pandemic, extreme weather conditions and the war in Ukraine as the other reasons for the rise in acute hunger. The Food and Agriculture Organisation says, most of the countries facing food crises depend heavily on Russia and Ukraine for their wheat imports. The populations facing acute hunger are found in countries like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Sudan, Syria and the Democratic Republic of Congo where ongoing conflict has forced thousands of people to flee their homes. The east of the DRC has more than a hundred rebel groups fighting over land, ethnic rivalries and political power. Security analysts say the illegal exploitation of minerals is also fueling the conflict there. The UN is now appealing for urgent financial support to prevent people in regions experiencing conflict from dying of starvation. -Reporting by Chris Ocamringa from Kinshasa
