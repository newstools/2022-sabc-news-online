Police dispersed a mob of angry learners from Dumisani Makhaye High School in Chatsworth, Durban, who were assaulting a man accused of stealing copper cables at the school. The pupils are said to have stood up to a man and when police arrived, they found the group of learners assaulting the suspect. In a statement, the provincial Department of Education commended the learners for standing up against what they have called hooligans. Police spokesperson Thenjiswa Ngcobo says, “They proceeded to the scene and found a group of learners assaulting a man in his thirties. The police then dispersed the crowd which was violent. They managed to rescue and he was taken to a hospital near the area for medical attention.” #sapsFS Members of Lejweleputswa District Reaction Team confiscated 290,5kg copper cable on 10/05 at Mannys, Welkom.
