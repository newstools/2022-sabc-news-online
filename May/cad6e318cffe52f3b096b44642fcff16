A 15-year-old learner at Zama primary school in Zastron, Free State, is expected to appear in the local magistrate’s court soon after fatally stabbing a fellow grade six learner. The suspect is reported to have been bullying the deceased. The principal sent the suspect home to bring his parents but he returned with a knife. The incident happened on Wednesday. Police say they are investigating a case of murder. Police spokesperson sergeant Peter Kareli says the suspect is in police custody. “Zastron police were called to a school where reports of a stabbing occurred. On arrival, members discovered that the suspect was chased and arrested by community members who witnessed the unfortunate incident. A teacher, who was nearby, took the victim in his vehicle with the knife still stuck in his chest to the hospital.” “On his way [the teacher] met with emergency services who unfortunately declared the 15-year-old dead before he could reach the hospital. The 15-year-old suspect was arrested and charged for the murder and he will appear in court soon,” explains Kareli.
