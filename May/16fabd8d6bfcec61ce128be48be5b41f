The ANC in the Eastern Cape says it will not allow any delegate who is not fully vaccinated, to attend its 9th elective conference in East London this weekend. The party says this will be in the best interest in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. The long-awaited conference will see the incumbent chairperson, Oscar Mabuyane going head-to-head with PTT member Babalo Madikizela and the Deputy Speaker of the provincial Legislature Mlibo Qoboshiyane, for the position of chairperson. At least 1 500 delegates are expected to elect the new provincial leaders of the party. Party Provincial Spokesperson Loyiso Magqashela says they are hoping for an incident free conference. “It becomes a requirement because we have had an experience of the COVID-19, which nobody invited. Therefore, in every gathering that we have, we have to lead by example of the ANC. We don’t want to bring anyone that has not been vaccinated amongst the people.” Mabuyane is confident that he will emerge as chairperson for a second term. “I will continue with the work that l am doing. l believe we have been doing justice to the work of the ANC. We are renewing ANC. We are strengthening the ANC. We are building the unity of the ANC. You need a united ANC for you to achieve anything.” Both Madikizela and Mabuyane support Cyril Ramaposa for a second term as ANC president.
