ANC National Executive Committee member, Ronald Lamola has remained non-committal on whether or not he has ambitions to contest for a position among the party’s top six. He, however, says the party’s leadership needs a generational mix. In December this year, the party will hold a national conference during which new leadership will be elected. He was speaking to the SABC News after delivering the O.R. Tambo Memorial Lecture in Thohoyandou, Limpopo, on Saturday. “The ANC, in all its structures, does need generational mix it. It does need a youthful organisation to infuse energy and also to infuse a new direction that is also what the generation of Tambo did (when) they came from the youth league the generation of Mandela and many generations of youth leagues, that is what must also happen in the national conference. There must be a generational mix for the ANC to remain relevant. (It) must infuse young people.” Lamola has called on party members to desist from killing each other for positions. In June this year, the ANC in Limpopo will hold the provincial conference. Chairperson Stanley Mathabatha will contest against ANC PEC member and Public Works MEC Namane Masemola. Lamola says party members must guard against political killings ahead of party conferences. “We must not kill each other for positions. We must not tear apart the ANC because of positions. Contestation is within the constitution. Let’s do it in a manner that still after the provincial, you will get out of the provincial conference of the ANC and still loving each other as delegates and not leave the provincial conference where you cannot even greet your neighbour who is a delegate in the same provincial conference (sic).” O.R.
