The man accused of the murder and rape of eight-year-old Tazne van Wyk is expected to go on trial in the High Court in Cape Town on Monday. The little girl from Elsies River went missing from near her parents’ home two years ago. Her body was found dumped in a stormwater drain in the Boland days later. The girl’s murder sparked widespread outrage. The alleged killer is a parolee with a long list of previous convictions. He was arrested in the Eastern Cape, a week after the child’s disappearance. Moyhdian Pangkaeker has previous convictions including child neglect, murder and theft, and dates back as far as the 1980s. Speaking to SABC News in February 2020, Van Wyk’s distraught family said her murder could have been prevented. More details in the video below:
