Mbalula says the policy is critical for fast-tracking the implementation of priority structural reforms to support economic recovery. “ The private sector with the gazetting of this is already calling, ready to move fast and furious. You are going to see work in the branch lines; we are talking from Mafikeng down to Johannesburg, from Botshabelo to Thaba’Nchu. All the branch lines that were dead, concessions and all tha,t there’s going to be a hype of activity.” This Framework will aim to guide the collaboration between the major SOEs and private sector companies to deliver new economic infrastructure. The pursuit of PSP should not be construed as the privatisation of the South African Railways, as there is no such policy on the table. pic.twitter.com/u1zCQsseIR — FIKILE MBALULA | MR FIX (@MbalulaFikile) May 9, 2022  In Conclusion, giving practical expression to the objectives of the White Paper on National Rail Policy requires of us to pay particular attention to skills development and growing the requisite capacity in the country. pic.twitter.com/WaE4UmqMxH — FIKILE MBALULA | MR FIX (@MbalulaFikile) May 9, 2022
