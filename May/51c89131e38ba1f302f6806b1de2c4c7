The African National Congress (ANC) national Spokesperson, Pule Mabe, has reiterated the party’s support for the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. This is despite several ANC members being implicated in Part Four of the State Capture report, which was officially handed over to the Presidency last week. According to the report, businessman Edwin Sodi made payments of over R300 000 to ANC treasurer-general, Paul Mashatile, over R6-million to former Health Minister, Doctor Zweli Mkhize, and R45 000 to Labour Minister, Thulas Nxesi. Others were over R170 000 to Deputy Intelligence Minister, Zizi Kodwa and R170 000 to Communications Deputy Minister, Pinky Kekana. Mabe says the party’s task team that was established to look into the findings of the commission is a testament to the party’s support for the commission and its work. “The position of the ANC has not changed. We support the work being done by the commission on State Capture. We have established a team within the organisation just as part of demonstrating that kind of support and make sure that there is some coordination at our level to make sure that they then assist in the formulation of an organisation-wide response that may need the ANC to understand.”
