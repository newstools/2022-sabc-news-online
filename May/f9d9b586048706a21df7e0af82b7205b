As Africa marks Africa Month, continental NPO Africa Rising for Justice, Peace and Dignity, a pan-african movement of people and organisations, have declared May 23-29, African Liberation week. They call it the biggest Pan-African mobilisation of actions in the world, wherein they want different organisations on the continent and diaspora, to reflect on the need for renewed unity and the need to manage our own affairs. The movement’s co-ordinator Coumba Toure shares about the initiative:  Giving platform launched The Centre on African Philanthropy and Social Investment has launched the Kisima African Giving Platform, an initiative that aims to highlight stories that focus on Africans making a difference in their communities. This platform promotes good giving stories from across Africa. The patron of Kisima African Giving Platform, Graça Machel, says if each person in Africa can donate $1 each, we will see a change in Africa’s socio-economic development. Professor Bheki Moyo, Director of the Centre of African Philanthropy and Social Investment at the Wits Business School, says the platform came about due to the impact of COVID-19 on different sectors of society. Moyo says that there was an enormous effort by society in helping each other during the economic impact of the pandemic but these responses were not largely given the spotlight. He says, “The spotlight is always given to those international actors that come up after a few days or weeks after a pandemic,  so we wanted to showcase these stories of solidarity, these stories of giving, these stories of sharing.”
