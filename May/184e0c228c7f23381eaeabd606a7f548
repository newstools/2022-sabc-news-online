Minister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Nathi Mthethwa, will kick off Africa Month on Monday with the Umoja Africa Carnival and Parade in Midrand, Johannesburg. He will be accompanied by a number of ambassadors, ministers, and MECs. The theme for this year’s Africa month celebration is The Year of Nutrition: Strengthening Resilience in Nutrition and Food Security on The African Continent. Since the Organisation of Africa Unity (OAU) was established in 1963, the African continent has been a pioneer in advancing continental unity. A series of events will be hosted throughout the month of May by the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture to celebrate Africa Month including a celebration of Africa Day on the 25th of May.
