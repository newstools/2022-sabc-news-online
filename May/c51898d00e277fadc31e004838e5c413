The ANC Youth League’s Limpopo elective conference has collapsed until further notice. The conference, which started on Friday with the registration process, was unable to have its opening ceremony – where the party’s provincial chairperson and Limpopo Premier, Stanley Mathabatha, was scheduled to deliver an address. On Saturday night, the conference was halted due to disputes over the credentials of some delegates. For the past three years, the governing party’s youth league has been run by a task team, following its failure to hold an elective conference. Political analyst, Dr Metji Makgoba, believes that the decision to halt the ANC Youth League’s elective conference in Limpopo, will help to restore public confidence in the organisation.  The ANCYL provincial congress preparatory committee is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to map a way forward.
