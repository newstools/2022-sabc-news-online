Political analyst Dr Ntsikelelo Breakfast says Premier Oscar Mabuyane stands a better chance than businessman Babalo Madikizela of being re-elected African National Congress (ANC) provincial chairperson. The election results of the conference will be announced later on Monday with party President Cyril Ramaphosa expected to close proceedings in the evening. Several senior ANC members in the province including Nelson Mandela Bay ANC member Andile Lungisa are vying for the top five positions. Lungisa was the only candidate for the position of treasurer in the Madikizela’s slate. But other names contending for his position came from the floor with Zolile Williams being nominated by 25% of the delegates to square up with him. Dr Breakfast says although the losing team should accept defeat, the results of the elections are likely to be legally challenged. “Democracy is not only about majoritarianism. Democracy also denotes that the losers must accept this for being defeated legitimately. I doubt if they will accept the outcome. I think this is going to play out in court,” explains Breakfast. The video below is reporting on credentials:  Credentials The ANC says it is working hard to improve the management of credentials at its provincial conferences. Voting is under way at the Eastern Cape 9th ANC Provincial conference which nearly hit a snag after delegates disagreed over the adoption of credentials. They argued over the inclusion of ten branches from the Dr WB Rubusana region who had failed to meet the requirements to participate in the conference. They also had an issue with the inclusion of delegates from the Veterans’ League saying they had no viable structure in the province. In 2017, the provincial conference descended into chaos when delegates also failed to agree on the credentials. ANC national spokesperson Pule Mabe says it is important to be thorough when dealing with credentials. ANC’s Pule Mabe addresses the conference:
