The Young Nurses Indaba Trade Union (YNITU) will march to the offices of the National Health Department, as well as the National Treasury in Tshwane on Wednesday morning, to hand over a memorandum of demands. President of the union, Rich Sicina says they are demanding an end to austerity measures that are creating chronic staff shortages in health facilities. “What we have discovered is that all CEO’s in different facilities are complaining about budgets, they are saying we don’t have money. We would like to fill these vacant posts of which there are about more than R10 000, but the problem is we do not have money because of austerity measures. The budget we were given by National Treasury, it doesn’t help us with anything,” says Sicina. VIDEO: Worker’s Day – Reflecting on frontline workers’ experiences during COVID-19: Rich Sicina
