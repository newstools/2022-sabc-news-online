The man accused of killing three people, including a police officer, at the New Somerset Hospital in Cape Town over the weekend has been identified as a former policeman, Jean-Paul Carl Malgas 39. Carl Malgas appeared in the Cape Town Magistrate Court on Tuesday on three murder charges, the illegal possession of a firearm and robbery. The case has been postponed to June 30, 2022, for further investigation. National Prosecution Authority’s spokesperson, Eric Ntabazalila says, “We explained in court for his safety and the safety of the public and the safety of court officials it was decided he must be kept in handcuffs and leg irons due to the crime that he committed. I am sure you know the details about how he grabbed the firearm from a police officer and shot that officer and the two patients at the hospital.” Carl Malgas’s attorney Shaun Balram says his client suffers from severe depression and is suicidal. “From the defence perspective, the instruction is not to bring bail application at this stage. The client currently is not in a good state of mind as you have heard in court he is suicidal. Therefore he decided to exercise his right to abandon bail application.” Relatives of six men killed in Khayelitsha live in fear:
