Like all other industries, the pandemic caused significant disruption to mining operations.  But once again, the industry has shown its resilience. In South Africa, mining registered growth of 11.8 % in 2021, the highest across all industries. Last year the sector recovered production to almost pre-COVID levels.” President Ramaphosa says mining remains a critical pillar of the economy. “Mining is a significant contributor to export earnings, it is an important source of foreign direct investment, and directly employs nearly half a million people  and we expect mining’s significance and contribution to our economy to grow.”
