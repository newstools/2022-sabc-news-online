Mpumalanga Premier, Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane, has urged parents to always guard their children. The Premier made the plea on Saturday after she visited the family of a six-year old reported missing in Mganduzweni, near White River. Bontle Mashiyane went missing two weeks ago. Residents held a prayer service for the safe return of the missing girl. Bontle was last seen playing with other children on the street near her home. It’s alleged that she later followed a neighbour, who told her that they are going to visit Bontle’s aunt. Police, who have been searching for Bontle, believe that Collen Hlongwane will assist them with their investigation. Bontle’s parents pleaded with Hlongwane to assist the police. Bontle’s mother, Permission Seepane, says: “The suspect Collen, who is the neighbour, should not be afraid, my child, alive or dead, bring her or drop her somewhere, we can be able to find her.” Bontle’s father, Itumeleng Mashiyane, is confident that her little daughter will be found. “We have not lost hope that the police will find the child, even though the days are going, we have confident to the police that they will find her still alive.” Premier Mtshweni-Tsipane visited the family. She is confident that police will make a breakthrough. “We are very much convinced that the suspect will be apprehended. We have been always tracing him, we find him here he goes off.  As I was coming here, we have dispatched another team to find the perpetrator somewhere. I’m yet to get a report where we able to get him, if not today, tomorrow.” Mtshweni-Tsipane has called on parents to guard their children. The community of Masoyi held a prayer service for the safe return of the little girl. Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtshweni-Tsipane visits Bontle Mashinyane’s family:
