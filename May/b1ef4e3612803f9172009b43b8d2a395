COVID-19 cases in Africa are on the rise. The Africa Centre for Diseases Control (CDC) and Prevention says over 37 000 cases have been recorded in recent weeks across the continent. It says 93% of the new cases are from Southern Africa. The continental body has also raised concerns about Sudan and Somalia, where the death rate is above 5%. Updating the media about the current trends of COVID-19 in Africa, CDC Deputy Director Ahmed Ogwell Ouma says the numbers are spiking in South Africa. “In terms of accumulating number of cases, today we are at 11.4 million COVID-19 cases that have been reported here in Africa. This accounts about 3% of the total number of cases that have been reported globally. The total number of deaths as of today is 252 000 and this gives us a case fatality rate 2,2% and unfortunately accounts for just over 4.1% of the deaths reported globally,” explains Ouma.
