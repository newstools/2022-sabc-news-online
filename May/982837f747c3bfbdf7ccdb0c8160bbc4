The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) in Mpumalanga says it is hopeful that the police investigation will assist in finding the killers of Hillary Gardee – the daughter of former EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee. Hillary was last seen on Friday shopping at a plaza in Mbombela. EFF leader in Mpumalanga, Collen Sedibe says Hillary’s body was discovered by farm workers on the R37 road between Mbombela and Mashishing. Sedibe says the police informed Gardee’s brother who also rushed to the scene where her body was found. EFF national spokesperson Sinawo Thambo says, “The three-year-old was saying mommy is fighting, so we got the impression that she had been taken against her will. Sadly, at nine o’clock this [Tuesday] morning, her lifeless body was found 60 kilometres outside Nelspruit.” “Unfortunately, this chapter has ended in a tragic manner. We send our deepest condolences to the Gardee family, and we also want to thank the ordinary people, who banded [reunited] behind the calls of trying to find her,” adds Thambo. Below is the full interview with Sinawo Thambo:  Meanwhile, politicians and ordinary South Africans took to Twitter to send their condolences to the Gardee family. I was praying she’d be found safe and sound. This is heart-breaking.
