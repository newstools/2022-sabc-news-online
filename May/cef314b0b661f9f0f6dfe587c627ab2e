Cabinet has raised concern over the recent increase in COVID-19 cases in the country. Health authorities have warned that South Africa may be entering a fifth wave of infections driven by the BA4 and BA5 Omicron sub-variants. This as the National Institute for Communicable Diseases recorded 10 017 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours. Ten more people have died from COVID-19 related complications. Cabinet urged South Africans to get vaccinated and continue with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele was briefing the media virtually on the outcomes of the Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. Gungubele says, “The virus is still a constant threat and vaccination remains the most effective weapon to protect ourselves. Cabinet is pleased that more people continue to choose vaccination as their first line of defence. Cabinet calls on those who have not yet been vaccinated to do so to protect themselves and their loved ones. We should also continue to adhere to all COVID-19 prevention protocols.” INFOGRAPHIC: Latest COVID-19 statistics in SA:  Loading… (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));
