President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africa is committed to taking the necessary actions to tackle climate change while supporting the local economy. The President was giving an opening address at Anglo American launch of the world’s first hydrogen-powered mining truck in Mogalakwena mine in Limpopo, on Friday. Ramaphosa recently linked the flooding in parts of KwaZulu-Natal in April to climate change. More than 400 people were killed, and billions of rands were lost. Ramaphosa described the unveiling of the world’s largest hydrogen-powered mine haul truck as a milestone. “Once plans to convert diesel power fleet with nuGen technology come into fruition, Anglo could move to 80% of diesel emissions at open pits mines. As a key to Paris agreement to combat climate change, SA is committed to take the necessary actions to transition our economy along with a low carbon climate resilient inclusive path,” adds President Ramaphosa.
