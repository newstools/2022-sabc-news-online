Eskom has implemented stage 2 rolling blackouts from 5pm to 10pm on Monday evening. The power utility says the power system is constrained, so it will implement load reduction during peak hours to avoid overloading its network and damaging infrastructure in high-density areas. Eskom spokesperson, Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says, “A generation unit each at Kriel, Grootvlei and Majuba power stations tripped this afternoon. This added to the severe constraints caused by delays in returning generation units that were expected this afternoon…” “As previously communicated, the capacity constraints are expected to persist during the evening peaks for the remainder of the week. But as we know the whole winter period will be constrained by generation capacity,’ adds Mantshantsha. Rolling Blackout | Eskom implements stage 2 rolling blackouts
