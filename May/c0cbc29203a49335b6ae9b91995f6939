This follows numerous incidents of attacks on Eskom employees in parts of Soweto and Mabopane north of Pretoria in the past few days. It is alleged that armed robberies attacked Eskom technicians while conducting repairs in the townships. Armed groups robbed the technicians of their wallets and cellphones. “With the problem we have with infrastructure and the people of Eskom being attacked, this should be seen in a very serious light. And in actual fact an act of terrorism. A high priority should be given to the safety of technicians who are rendering the service out there. I think all forces should join hands.”
