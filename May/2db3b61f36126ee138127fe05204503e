The current leadership of boxing in South Africa is pulling out all the stops to revive the sport in the country. Following a two-day strategic workshop in Kempton Park, the regulatory body for professional boxing in the country, Boxing South Africa, has unveiled a detailed five-point plan for restoring the sport to its former glory. Attendees of the strategic workshop included BSA’s current board as well as all the stakeholders in the boxing fraternity, including boxing promoters and licencees in the sport. Chairperson of the BSA board Luthando Jack says the regulatory body is fully behind the budding trend of exhibition fights involving musicians and other celebrities which are seen as yet another way of reviving the sport of boxing in South Africa, and need to be managed within the restrictions of the boxing governing laws. “We see celebrity boxing as an innovation so we welcome it. For instance the last tournament at Sun City we looked at as a pilot, and there are some lessons that we have drawn out of it with the view of basically sharpening a draft framework we had in place regarding how such fights ought to be organised,” added Jack. Boxing South Africa says that they are happy with the work that they have done in galvanising the entire boxing fraternity and reaching all provinces in the country with the message to renew, grow, and transform. The organisation shares that their agenda has been supported by all the stakeholders within boxing, and implementation is all that is now required.
