The Roads Agency Limpopo (RAL) is faced with a huge backlog of bridges and roads that need to be repaired. RAL is yet to repair about 17 bridges that were damaged due to cyclone Eloise that hit some parts of the province three years ago. The most affected are the Vhembe and Mopani districts. In the Capricorn district, a damaged bridge on the mountain pass at Chuenespoort outside Polokwane is yet to be repaired. RAL Board Chairperson, Matome Ralebipi says the agency does not have enough budget to repair the roads and bridges. Ralebipi says, “There are 17 bridges that were affected by cyclone Eloise in this past year or two in the current financial year of 2021-2022. We will maintain and fix the seven bridges as the budget becomes available. The backlog for rehabilitation of roads is quite big in the province but as an when we get budget availability we will definitely be tackling the issue of potholes and deteriorating infrastructure in the province.”
