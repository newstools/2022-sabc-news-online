The African Development Bank Group says it will continue to push for infrastructure development as one of the effective ways of unlocking economic growth on the continent. This as Africa is battling with economic recovery, looming food crisis and the effects of climate change. The bank’s Vice-President Swazi Tshabalala spoke in Accra, Ghana, where the institution is hosting its annual meeting. The African Development Bank Group says with its limited resources it won’t leave Africa in the lurch. It’s willing to be a strategic partner when it comes to industrialisation, improvement of quality of life and secure reliable energy. Tshabalala added that they are committed to assisting countries like South Africa as it seeks just energy transition. Tshabalala says this is a welcomed move and climate change has been a serious impediment. It’s also left a trail of destruction on the continent as it is dealing with deadly floods, desertification and other natural disasters.
