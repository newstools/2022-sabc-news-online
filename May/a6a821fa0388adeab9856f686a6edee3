Public Protector advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane has found the Dawid Kruiper Municipality in the Northern Cape guilty of improper conduct and maladministration. This, after the Upington based municipality failed to compensate two complainants for the loss of their livestock in 2016. The complainants, Tununu Lankalebalela and Mavela Mahlokomane sustained the loss of their livestock as a result of electrocution from a powerline in the Hondejag area. In her investigative report, the public protector indicates that the complainants submitted claims to the municipality in august 2016, but to date their compensation for loss of their livestock remains outstanding. The complainants respectively suffered a loss of R16 000 and R11 000. According to the pp report the municipality in this case delayed to submit the complainants’ claims to the municipality’s insurance and the undue delay was therefore improper and constitutes maladministration.
