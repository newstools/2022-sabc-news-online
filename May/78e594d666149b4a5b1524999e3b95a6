The high court in East London has dismissed with costs an urgent application that sought to recuse some branch delegates of the Dr W B Rubusana region from participating in the ANC’s provincial conference in East London. The application was brought by Ondela Sokoman, a member of the region. Sokomani’s legal team argued that about 30 branches are not eligible to vote in the conference since there is a pending court judgement on allegations of membership manipulation which took place at branch general meetings in this region.  Judge Justin Laing said there was no urgency in the matter and the application was done in a hasty manner.
