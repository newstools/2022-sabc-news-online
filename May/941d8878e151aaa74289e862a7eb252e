Officials of two NGOs are expected to testify on Monday in the Life Esidimeni Inquest in the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria. Former clinical manager at Mosego Home and former Head of Anchor House will take the stand. About 100 people died at four NGOs including Takalani Home in Soweto‚ Mosego House in Krugersdorp‚ Precious Angels in Atteridgeville‚ the Cullinan Care and the Rehabilitation Centre which housed two other NGOs‚ Anchor House and Siyabadinga. The inquest is trying to determine whether any Gauteng Health officials, or NGO owners can be held criminally liable for the deaths of 144 mentally-ill patients in 2016. In March, the inquest heard that psychiatric patients were malnourished and that their weight loss was abnormal. This is according to physician specialist, Professor Gregory Tintinger. Tintinger shed light on the medical cause of deaths of mental health patients, based on postmortems. Tintinger testified that the postmortem examinations did not suggest the exact cause of deaths. “When the person has lost 27% of their body weight in just three months that’s very abnormal. We will always try and establish the cause for such a degree of weight [loss].” The video below is reporting more on the Life Esidimeni Inquest:
