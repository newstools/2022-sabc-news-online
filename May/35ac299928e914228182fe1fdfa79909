Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan says Eskom is still plagued by corruption and malpractices at various levels. These include the quality of coal, the purchase at the power station level, and the technical maintenance quality. He says good managers who try to challenge these practices are often threatened in various ways in order to intimidate them. In a written response to an EFF question, Gordhan says that in its current state, it would be difficult for any executive to turn around Eskom and that the current leadership should be given as much support as possible. ‘Design defects’ The Minister says the lack of maintenance of coal plants has resulted in high unplanned plant breakdowns that are causing power cuts. He says Medupi and Kusile power stations have not been performing due to design defects. He goes on to say that the building program was prioritised in terms of funding as part of the looting that occurred at the entity during the state capture period. Skills deficit Furthermore, he claims that the previous management’s harassment and victimisation of competent engineers resulted in the loss of valuable skilled members of the operational team, exacerbating the situation. Gordhan adds that the tentacles of the corrupt former executives are still reaching into Eskom and undermining the work of the current leadership.
