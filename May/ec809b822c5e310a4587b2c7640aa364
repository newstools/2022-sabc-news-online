As KwaZulu-Natal records a spike in new COVID-19 infections, scientists are calling on health authorities to take decisive action before this escalates further. The province has over 14 000 current active cases. According to the provincial Department of Health, just over 2.7 million people have been fully vaccinated. 4.4 million people in the province have not taken a single dose of the vaccine. Association of Medical Councils of Africa, President Dr Kgosi Letlape says while government has done a tremendous effort to provide vaccines, access in remote areas remains a challenge. “We should have made vaccine part of the health system. Just like the normal vaccines, we should have utilised independent health care professionals like GPs [general practitioners]. What we have done is create ivory tower system where people needed to go to the vaccine rather vaccine going to the people.” “If you look at our senior citizens in our townships and in our villages, if you want them to pay for their own transport instead of bringing it to them, you are not increasing the access. We should have done more in terms of dealing [with] people’s questions. We should have put extra efforts. So that people can be educated. I find people who are still confused about whether they should vaccinate or not vaccinate,” explains Dr Letlape.
