The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says the man accused of slitting the throat of an eight year old Girl will remain in custody after he abandoned his bail application at the Mamelodi West Regional Court, East of Pretoria. The 31-year-old from Mamelodi East is facing a charge of attempted murder. The accused and the mother of the child are in a relationship. The child is in an Intensive Care Unit in hospital. The accused handed himself over at Hammanskraal Police Station. Themba Masango, Secretary General of the #Notinmyname movement, has expressed relief that he is not out on bail. “Notinmyname International is very happy and pleased that the perpetrator was refused bail. He will return to the Mamelodi Regional Court on the 30th of May. Notinmyname will be back out there in our numbers to make sure that justice for Rea is served. We continue to call upon all forward-thinking South Africans, especially Mamelodi citizens to come out in their numbers on the 30th to make sure that this perpetrator never sees the light of day,” says Masango.
