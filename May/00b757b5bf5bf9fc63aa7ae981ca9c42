Eskom has announced that rolling blackouts will be suspended from 12pm on Saturday. The power utility says emergency reserves have been adequately replenished and are available to support the system next week. Eskom implemented power cuts since Tuesday. Eskom Spokesperson, Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says the public is urged to continue to using electricity sparingly. “The power system has recovered to a point where load shedding can be stopped at 12 today, on Saturday. The emergency reserves have been adequately replenished and are available to support the system next week. Although we have brought back these generators, the onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to a constrained system throughout the winter. We therefore urge all South Africans to continue using electricity sparingly. Eskom would again like thank the people of South Africa for their patience and support during this period of loadshedding,” saysEskom Spokesperson, Sikhonathi Mantshantsha. #POWERALERT1 Loadshedding will be suspended at 12:00 as generation capacity sufficiently recovers pic.twitter.com/SBmLSEbhCX — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) May 7, 2022
