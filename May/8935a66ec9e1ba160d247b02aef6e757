Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula, is on Friday expected to engage with the community that is illegally living on the railway infrastructure on the Cape Town central line in Langa. People from different areas in the province invaded the piece of land in 2019.  The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) has been trying to relocate the community since then. Mbalula says they will present plans to relocate the community to the Monwabisi Recreational Centre in Langa. Mbalula will also assess the ongoing work to recover the central line.
