The Nelson Mandela Bay Metro is in the grip of a water crisis as its five supply dams run dry. Currently, the dams only have enough water for the next 38 days. The municipality says 40% of the city will experience dry taps if no significant rainfall in the next month. The affected areas include the Western Suburbs, St Albans prison, Greenbushes and areas in Kariega. Later on Thursday, Mayor Eugene Johnson will host public information sessions with residents to inform them about this crisis.
