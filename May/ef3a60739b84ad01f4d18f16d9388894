The University of KwaZulu-Natal’s (UKZN) has appointed a new chancellor, Dr Reuel Khoza. Dr Khoza has decades of experience in management. He says he hopes to transform the educational landscape. In an interview with SABC News, he explains some of the immediate challenges that institutions of higher learning face in the country. “There is clearly inadequate funding. I believe something needs to be done there. We cannot depend on government completely to provide requisite funding, particularly for research and development. I think we need to make common cause with major corporations,” explains Dr Khoza.
