President Cyril Ramaphosa says work is progressing well to reform South Africa’s network industries to ensure the growth of the economy, create jobs and encourage investment. In his letter to the nation, Ramaphosa says that the latest Operation Vulindela‘s quarterly report demonstrates this. The report outlines the government’s efforts to resolve structural problems in the areas of electricity, water, transport and telecommunications. The government established Operation Vulindela in October 2020 to identify challenges in these network industries and provide technical support to the responsible departments. Ramaphosa says these industries are critical to the economy. Amongst the achievements of Operation Vulindelela according to the President is the recent auction of spectrum for mobile telecommunications and the establishment of the National Ports Authority aimed at improving efficiency at the country’s ports. He also lists the formulation of a new national rail policy by the cabinet and reforms to facilitate increased power generation by independent producers and reforms at Eskom. Ramaphosa has urged businesses to take advantage of these developments and turn pledges into concrete job-creating investments. Operation Vulindlela update:
