Anglo American Chief Executive Officer Duncan Wanblad has hailed the development of a massive hydrogen-powered mine truck as evidence of South Africa’s move toward a greener future and, says mining will continue to contribute to community upliftment. Wanblad was speaking at the unveiling of the giant vehicle at the Mogalakwena platinum mine, outside Mokopane, in Limpopo. Wanblad says mining remains a key part of the economy. “This is the testimony of the power of technology and a symbol of how far mine has come. We need to contribute toward creating a cleaner, greener, healthier and sustainable market. Society at large has to be part of this journey [and] have to benefit from this journey.” The giant hydrogen-powered mine haul truck is designated to operate in everyday mining conditions for production and waste purposes. Anglo American Platinum launches its first of its kind hydrogen-powered haul truck:  New industries President Cyril Ramaphosa says the launch of the nuGen hydrogen-powered truck is a remarkable milestone that will lead to the creation of new industries in South Africa and an economy that is more sustainable. The massive lorry can carry a 290-tonne load of rock. The President says by pursuing green solutions – the country will achieve a more innovative and more resourceful economy. “Developing the hydrogen economy is a strategic priority for our country that is why I say once again that this is a smart step for Anglo American but it’s a gigantic step for SA’s hydrogen future economy. Our objection is to be the real hub of green hydron production. It will lead to the creation of new industries and I’d like us to imagine that this is another gold, another minefield of diamonds.” The video below is reporting on the unveiling:  Anglo American recently made pledges to assist the country to achieve a cleaner energy future at the South Africa Investment Conference.
