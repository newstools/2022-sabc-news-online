Meanwhile, the newly-constituted league has has made a pronouncement that current Youth League Task Team Convenor, Nonceba Mhlauli should be the league’s president come the 26th national congress. The province believes Mhlauli has the skill to re-build the youth league to its former glory. Rebuilding is a process. It is not an overnight thing. So we need to afford her the opportunity to stake the structure up. The foundation is there. The next person will come in and put the roofing. So we have confidence in the leadership of comrade Nonceba Mhlauli,” said Blenies.
