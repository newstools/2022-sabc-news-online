More than 36 000 candidates for the National Senior Certificate (NSC) are set to start their exams in the Western Cape on Monday. About 13 000 of the candidates are adults and young people who are out of school while the majority of the candidates are writing to improve their marks from last year. Outgoing provincial Education Minister, Debbie Schäfer, says there are 174 exam centres across the province with a selection of languages being the first paper to be written. Schäfer has wished the candidates well. “Last year’s November NSC proceeded with minimal disruption, to the credit of the residents of the Western Cape. I appeal to them once again to make sure that absolutely no disruptions prevent our candidates from achieving their best possible results. They deserve the support of every one of us during these exams. I wish all candidates the very best as they tackle their exams and invest in their futures. Work hard, do your best, and know that we are here to support you to the fullest.”
