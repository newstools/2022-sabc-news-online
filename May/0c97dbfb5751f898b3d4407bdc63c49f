Cabinet has welcomed the arrest of three suspects in connection with the murder of Hillary Gardee, daughter of former Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Secretary General, Godrich Gardee. Hillary’s body was found at a plantation near Mbombela last week, days after she was reported missing. Meanwhile, Cabinet has also condemned the mass killings in Khayelistha in Cape Town where six men were gunned down at the weekend. Minister in the Presidency, Mondli Gungubele was briefing the media virtually on the outcomes of the Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. Gungubele says, “Cabinet continues to condemn the senseless killing of women and has welcomed the swift response by law enforcement officers in arresting suspects in connection with the death of Ms Hillary Gardee.” “Cabinet further condemned the killing of six people in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. These senseless murders are a reminder that we must do more as a society to violence and gender-based violence and femicide. Cabinet urged all people in the country to work with the government in the fight against crime on GBV. Together, we can ensure that our community and streets are safer for all including the elderly, women and children.” VIDEO: On Monday, the case against the three men accused of the murder of Hillary Gardee was postponed:
