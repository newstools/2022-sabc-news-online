The South African Transport and Allied Workers Union (Satawu) say it believes that Transnet board members should be held equally accountable for the mismanagement and maladministration at the utility. This follows the recent arrest of former Transnet officials on charges of fraud, corruption, and money laundering. Among the arrests is the former chief executive, Siyabonga Gama. The accused were granted bail after appearing in court. “We believe that not only Siyabonga Gama should be appearing but also the board should be charged because they failed to play their over site role. There is no way that such allegations can come within the institution where there is a board that has to make sure that everything is done correctly and by following the laws. Therefore, if they failed to execute their duties, they must be charged as well,” SATAWU’s Deputy General Secretary, Anele Kiet. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has warned of more arrests after five former Transnet officials were arrested for alleged corruption . They have also been charged with contravening the Financial Management Act when former President Jacob Zuma was in power.
