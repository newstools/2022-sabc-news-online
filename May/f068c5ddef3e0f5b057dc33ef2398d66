Emmanuel Macron sworn-in for a second term as president on Saturday. In a country where presidents rarely get re-elected, Macron won 58.5% of the votes in the second round against the far-right’s Marine Le Pen, despite strong opposition to his pro-business policies and a proposal to raise the retirement age. In a short speech, he spoke of the need to innovate at a time of unprecedented challenges for the world and for France, and said his second term would be “new” and not merely a continuation of the first. He highlighted the threat posed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and global environmental concerns.

His second mandate will officially start on the following Saturday. Among the 500 guests present were former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, former prime ministers Edouard Philippe, Manuel Valls, Alain Juppe and Jean-Pierre Raffarin, as well as religious leaders and other state figures. Macron’s inauguration marks the end of one electoral campaign and the opening of another – for legislative elections in June. A newly united political left a coalition formed between hard-left La France Insoumise, the Parti Socialiste, the Greens and the Communist Party, is hoping to deprive Macron of a majority in parliament.
