Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said on Monday that comments by Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in a contentious interview on Italian television were false and “obscene.” Draghi told reporters that Italy, unlike Russia, allowed freedom of expression, and had allowed Lavrov to give his views in Sunday’s interview “even when false and aberrant … the parton Hitler was obscene.” Israel summoned the Russian ambassador after Lavrov said he believed Adolf Hitler had Jewish origins. “It is an unforgivable, scandalous statement, a terrible historical mistake, and we expect an apology,” Israeli Foreign Ministry Yair Lapid told the YNet news website.  There was no immediate comment from the Russian embassy.  During an interview with Italy’s Rete 4 channel, Lavrov was asked how Russia could say it needed to “denazify” Ukraine, when the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, was Jewish.  “When they say ‘What sort of nazification is this if we are Jews‘, well I think that Hitler also had Jewish origins, so it means nothing,” Lavrov said, speaking through an Italian interpreter.  “For a long time now we’ve been hearing the wise Jewish people say that the biggest anti-Semites are the Jews themselves,” he added.  Israel has expressed repeated support for Ukraine. But wary of straining relations with Russia, a powerbroker in neighbouring Syria, it initially avoided direct criticism of Moscow and has not enforced formal sanctions on Russian oligarchs.  Last month, Lapid accused Russia of committing war crimes in Ukraine, and Israel agreed to supply helmets and vests to Ukrainian rescue services, signalling a shift in its position on providing such equipment.
