The Durban High Court is on Thursday expected to hear evidence from the security guards of sugar manufacturing company, Tongaat Hulett, in a matter involving murder accused Sayefundeen del Vecchio. Del Vecchio is facing a charge of malicious damage to property for a 2017 incident. The Tongaat Hulett matter is separate to charges of kidnapping, theft, robbery and two counts of murder for the 2018 killing of Doctor Rachel and Rodney Saunders. He along with Fatima Patel and Mussa Jackson are also facing charges in the murder case. On Wednesday, the court heard that Del Vecchio had an indemnity agreement with the company but failed to live up to it after they discovered that he had allegedly removed indigenous plants and killed some animals within the property. It is said that after the termination of the agreement the company received information that the accused had allegedly set alight the company’s sugarcane plantation. The court heard that the fire caused massive damage leaving the company with a financial loss of over 2.3 million. Del Vecchio and his two co-accused Fatima Patel and Mussa Jackson have pleaded not guilty to kidnapping, theft, robbery and murder of the couple.
