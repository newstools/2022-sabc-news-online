Zambia’s President Hakainde Hichilema says conflict in countries is hampering development in the mining sector. Hichilema, who took office less than a year ago, has highlighted corruption and a lack of stability as elements that are crippling business relations in the sector in some countries. He says his country is open for business and is focused on rooting out problems that negatively affect the mining sector. Hichilema addressed delegates at the Mining Indaba in Cape Town. “We are open for business. I am open to engage and partner with all of you here and those that are not present today. As many of you are aware, Zambia is a key player in the global copper mining industry and vast reserves. We are addressing factors that constrain investments and putting in place factors that catalyse these investments,” adds President Hichilema. Below is the live stream for Africa Mining Indaba:
