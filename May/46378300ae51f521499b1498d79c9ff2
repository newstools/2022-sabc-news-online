The offices of the embattled Nkomazi Local Municipality,in Mpumalanga,  remain closed. The residents shut down the municipal offices in an attempt to force the Executive Mayor Johan Mkhatshwa and council Speaker Sphiwe Mashele to resign. The two were expelled from the African National Congress (ANC) for allegedly defying the party after the local government elections in November last year. Mkhatshwa, Mashele and five other councillors allegedly voted with the opposition. Mkhatshwa and Mashele also allegedly accepted nominations from the floor and the other councillors who supported them against the ANC directive. The ANC recommended that Phindile Magagula and Hilda Nyambi be nominated for the positions of Mayor and Speaker respectively. The councillors including Mkhatshwa and the Speaker have since taken the ANC to court.
