Young tennis sensation Carlos Alcaraz has made history after he reached the final on the Madrid Open on home soil. The Spaniard became the youngest player to defeat a world number one tennis player in 17 years. The 19-year old Alcaraz beat three time champion Novak Djokovic in three sets 6-7, 7-5, and 7-6 to reach the final in a match that lasted more than three and a half hours. Alcaraz also became the first player ever to defeat Djokovic and Rafael Nadal back to back on a clay course. This was the first ever ATP head to head meeting between top seed Novak Djokovic and the home favourite Carlos Alcaraz. The 19-year Alcaraz caused a major shock when he defeated Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals on Friday after three previous attempts.
