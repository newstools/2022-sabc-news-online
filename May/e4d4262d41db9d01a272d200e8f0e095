The Eastern Cape Safety MEC, Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe, has commended law enforcement agencies for arresting a suspected corrupt license official stationed at the Port St Johns License Testing Centre. The 36-year-old official was caught red-handed. Police nabbed him moments after trying to bribe an inspector with R10 000. It is alleged that the suspect was selling learner’s and driving licenses. The bribe was in exchange for officers to squash some corruption evidence against the officer. The suspect will appear in court on Monday. “The MEC for Transport in the Eastern Cape Weziwe Tikana-Gxothiwe has commended the collaborative work between the anti-corruption unit of the SAPS as well as traffic officers in the province which led to the arrest of this 36-year-old suspect, who was stationed at the Port St John’s testing centre. He faces charges of paying a bribe to officers while there is also compelling evidence that he was involved in the sale of learners and driver’s licenses in that area,” says Unathi Binqose, Departmental spokesperson.
