Vaccine hesitancy decreased slightly from 28 percent in July 2021 to 25 percent in November 2021. That’s according to a COVID-19 Democracy Survey that the University of Johannesburg and the Human Sciences Research Council had conducted. The online survey has also revealed support for compulsory workplace vaccinations. Doctor Dhlomo says they will use various campaigns to improve on their messaging. “Persuasion through correct and frequent messages, after receiving the report of the survey, probably our GCIS should come up with a plan. That is probably an area in which government should start improving on our communication in that regard,” says Dhlomo.
