The murder case of a 15-year-old learner from Zama Primary School in Zastron, Free State, has been postponed in order for the local Magistrates Court to consider the Social Worker’s report. Last Wednesday, the accused allegedly stabbed a 15-year-old Grade 6 classmate outside the schoolyard.
The accused threatened to stab the deceased with a spoon after the two students got into an argument. The accused was ordered by the school principal to return home and bring his parents. Instead, the accused brought a knife and waited outside the schoolyard for the deceased. He then allegedly stabbed him in the chest. The learner will remain at the Department of Social Development, One Stop Centre until his next court appearance. NPA spokesperson Phaladi Shuping says, “He appeared before the court today [Wednesday] after the case for the Social Worker report. We have received a report. Our prosecutor went through that report and she requested the case be postponed to May 25, 2022. So that she can discuss the content of that report with the Senior Prosecutor for the two to decide on a way forward so that we can know how we are going to deal with matters going forward.”
