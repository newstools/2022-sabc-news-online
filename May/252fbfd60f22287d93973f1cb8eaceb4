The KwaZulu-Natal Health Department will commemorate International Nurses Day at the King Cetshwayo District in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday. The annual day is commemorated internationally on the anniversary of Florence Nightingale’s birthday on May 12th. Nightingale is considered as the founder of modern day nursing. South Africa also remembers the country’s first black nurse Cecilia Makiwane. The department says nurses have diligently responded to a series of disasters that have confronted the province. pic.twitter.com/XVgrlYE050 — KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health (@kznhealth) May 12, 2022  The Minister of Health, Dr Joe Phaahla expressed gratitude to health workers who have been continously in the frontline to fight against #COVID19 pandemic #HealthBudgetSpeech2022 pic.twitter.com/bPcC8KHr1u — Department of Health (@HealthZA) May 11, 2022  Vital Signs | International Nurses Day: 11 May 2022
