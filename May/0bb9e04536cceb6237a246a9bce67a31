The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it has a strong case against the three suspects who appeared in the Nelspruit Magistrate’s Court on Monday in the murder case of 28-year-old Hillary Gardee. The three are charged with kidnapping, rape, murder, firearms and ammunition, defeating the ends of justice, and conspiracy to commit murder. They abandoned their bail application and will be back in court on the 9th of June. Gardee, who was the daughter of the former EFF secretary-general, Godrich Gardee, was abducted and killed two weeks ago. Mpumalanga NPA Spokesperson, Monica Nyuswa, says the state will oppose bail. Meanwhile, one of the suspects is said to be a member of Eswatini’s People United Democratic Movement (Pudemo).  Pudemo has since confirmed this in a statement. Protest by EFF members Earlier, members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and community members protested outside the court. The protesters were singing struggle songs and demanding that the suspects be denied bail. The protesters, who were mostly women, said they no longer feel safe. In the video below, EFF leadership addressed crowds outside the court:
