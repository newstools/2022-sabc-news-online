The African National Congress (ANC) says its working hard to improve the management of its credentials. The Eastern Cape 9th ANC Provincial conference nearly hit a snag after delegates disagreed over the adoption of credentials. They were arguing over the inclusion of ten branches from the Dr WB Rubusana region who failed meet the requirements to participate in the conference. They also had an issue with the inclusion of delegates from the veterans league saying the veterans have no viable structure in the province. In 2017, the provincial descended into chaos when delegates also failed to agree on the credentials. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said they are trying to be thorough when dealing with credentials. ANC EASTERN CAPE ELECTIVE CONFERENCE MEDIA BRIEFING: Meanwhile, Nelson Mandela Bay African National Congress member Andile Lungisa, who is vying for the treasurer position on Babalo Madikizela’s slate, has told delegates that his grouping would object to adopting credentials. The group feels strongly that branches with what he considers to be ‘questionable status’ should be excluded from participating at the conference. They took the matter to court on Saturday night, but it was struck off the roll by the Eastern Cape High Court in East London. The three day conference was initially planned to end on Sunday evening, but there has been delays with the verification process for credentials of delegates attending the conference. Lungisa says he’s been cleared to participate in the conference following his prior conviction… “I do not have any issue, you must remember charges were meted against me, through the internal DC of the ANC, I was cleared by that DC, of the ANC nationally. I’m a cleared person, by the internal DC of the ANC, if you don’t like my face or you don’t like my looks, it’s not really my problem.” ANC Eastern Cape conference I Andile Lungiswa speaks out
