Eskom says mounting attacks on its technicians hinder progress for repair work and completion of crucial projects in various residential areas across Gauteng. Several incidents of attacks on Eskom’s employees have been reported in Soweto, west of Johannesburg, and Mabopane, north of Pretoria, recently. Eskom’s spokesperson in Gauteng, Amanda Qithi says due to the violence employees suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress “This display of aggression and violence by communities also leads to employees suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress, depression, and anxiety. It also results in a delay in repair and project completion. And further extends the period which residents spend without electricity. “Those who might be aware of such acts of violence to report them by calling Eskom’s crime line number on 0800 112 722 or the South African Police. The tip-offs can also be done anonymously. We’ve reported this o the SAPS,” Qithi adds.
