The workers affiliated with the Food Allied Workers Union (FAWU) at one of the biggest citrus farms Zebediela Citrus Estate in Limpopo have downed tools over wage demands. They’re demanding an R1 500 raise for contract workers and a 15% raise for full-time employees. They also want all workers on fixed-term contracts to be absorbed. Since Monday, the workers have been on strike. Some striking workers say their salaries are not in line with their scope of work. The farm’s management has remained silent on the strike. “One other thing we don’t want the contractors because they don’t pay. Things are not going well here on the farm 15% of the community should be part of the board being sold to the CPA we want the fifteen percent to be returned to the community. People have resigned and they are not getting their provident fund,” a worker explains. The labour union FAWU, spokesperson, Edwin Mabowa says apart from failing to meet the workers’ demands, they demand that management make payment of all provident fund arrears. “The instruction was that we take the matter to the CCMA, at the CCMA the employer did not come with anything, we have got seven demands they did not respond on one demand as a result CCMA issued out a certificate to strike, that’s why you see us here today, the strike commenced, so the demands are one its salary increase, two the update or payment of pension fund,” says Mabowa.
