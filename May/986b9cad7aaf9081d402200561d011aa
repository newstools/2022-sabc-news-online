Gordhan says the entity has also achieved savings of R 50 billion through its savings programme that started in the 2019 and 2020 financial year. He says, “A further reduction in debt to R396 billion was also achieved. The restructuring process is moving apace and transmission company has already been set up… and all that is being awaited is the finances to enable Eskom to move in this direction.” Sabotage Gordhan says acts of sabotage continue to contribute to Eskom’s struggles in providing power. He says someone had cut an important cable at Hendrina Power Station that would have allowed it to be connected to the rest of the grid. The Minister says this is one of several incidents of sabotage and corruption that have been exposed in recent days.
