President Cyril Ramaphosa says he will work hard to ensure the Aspen COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing facility in the Eastern Cape does not close. It is facing possible closure due to a lack of orders. Ramaphosa says he is engaging African Heads of State to purchase vaccines made on the continent and specifically in Gqeberha. The Aspen Pharmacare facility, manufacturing vaccines, was launched last year but to date, it has not received a single order from other countries. Minister Patel opens SA’s first Aspen’s anaesthetics manufacturing line:  Only 30% of the country’s population has also been vaccinated, with a fifth wave of COVID-19 looming. Ramaphosa says he will approach other African heads of state to purchase vaccines from South Africa. “Its cause for concern that vaccines are just laying fellow and not being procured. I have started engagements with the President of Zambia, Uganda, Malawi and Kenya. We will also be engaging with the rest of the world to procure vaccines made in Africa.”
