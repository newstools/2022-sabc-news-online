The University of South Africa (Unisa) has terminated the employment contracts of five staffers, who led the disruption of graduation ceremonies between March and April this year. The five employees , who were striking National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) members,  have been on precautionary suspension since April 19, following their participation in illegal strike action. In a statement, Unisa says they violated the institution’s Ethics and Employee Disciplinary Codes. Reasons for the termination of their contracts also include violating a court order, the incitement of public violence and malicious damage to property. The university says despite the warning issued to striking Nehawu members, they continued with the unlawful action.
