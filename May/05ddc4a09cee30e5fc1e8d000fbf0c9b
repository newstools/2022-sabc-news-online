Former Mayor of the Thulamela Local Municipality in Limpopo Avhashoni Tshafhango says the African National Congress (ANC) leadership must advise him regarding the step-aside rule. Tshafhango is resisting the rule saying he does not hold any position in the party. The ANC had given him until the end of this week to step aside as a party member. Tshifhango has a pending case of corruption relating to an investment made by the municipality into the defunct VBS Bank. He says, “I’m just an ordinary member of the ANC. I did not hold any position in the ANC. I’m not in the BEC; I’m not in the REC; I’m not in the province where I can say that I’m relinquishing my position as the secretary or as the treasurer. I didn’t step aside. I’m just awaiting the ANC to advise me on how I must step aside because I’m just ordinary member of the ANC,” says Tshafhango. ANC’s NEC has resolved that members affected by the step-aside rule will no longer be eligible to contest for the ANC’s positions. ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe says their members affected by the step aside rule should have done the honourable thing and written to the organisation that they recognise their election, but while their cases are pending they will be stepping aside from their responsibility as is required by the ANC. Mabe says elected members affected by the policy should step aside but that does not in any way suggest that the member is guilty of wrongdoing.
