The film revolves around Bharuccha trying to fight society and work as a saleswoman selling condoms to earn a living. “While writing, this was in my mind that why not a girl sell condoms who will make everyone aware and as I have told in the film that condom for men is a need but for women is a necessity and we have brought this film with this thought,” said Shaandilyaa. “We have only seen boys and men selling condoms you know, so we were about to do something new that would inspire other women as well. So, while writing, this was in my mind that why not a girl who sells condoms makes everyone aware and as I have told in the film that condom for men is a need but for women is a necessity and we have brought this film with this thought.” Directed by Jai Basantu Singh, the film is slated to hit the theatres on May 10.
