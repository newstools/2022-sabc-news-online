Eskom says rolling blackouts will be reduced to stage 1 at 22h00 pm on Friday evening, due to the lower weekend demand. The power utility says the rolling blackouts will continue at that level until 05:00am on Monday morning. The power utility introduced stage 2 rolling blackouts on Tuesday due to delays in returning generators to service, as well as the breakdown of nine generators. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha has urged the public to continue using electricity sparingly. #POWERALERT1 Due to lower weekend demand loadshedding will lowered to Stage 1 from 22:00 until 05:00 on
