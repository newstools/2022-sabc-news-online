Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi says the migration of Early Childhood Development (ECD) from the Department of Social Development to his department is a major achievement as it will ensure that children are given the necessary support from grade R until they start grade one. Lesufi says there would be a common syllabus in all ECD centres. He says learners will be exposed to mathematics, physical science and life sciences subjects from an early age. The Gauteng Education MEC says this will help reduce the number of learners dropping out of school. He says the department already started to establish Grade R classes at Gauteng schools and will ensure that there will be Grade R classes in all schools by the end of the year. The MEC was addressing the media on his department’s budget of almost R60 billion for the 2022/23 financial year at the Gauteng Legislature. “Gone are the days when our children will just simply be dropped at a creche for them to pray, sing, eat and go back home. We are investing lots of resources to ensure that [we] firstly train educators, develop a curriculum. Thirdly [we] have a standard of infrastructure that must be utilized across our province. Lastly, which is crucial, monitor their progress. This will assist us to ensure that every learner can be tracked, traced and we can understand their social well-being,” explains MEC Lesufi.
