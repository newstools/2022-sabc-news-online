The Polokwane High Court in Limpopo is expected to hand down sentencing to a convicted serial rapist. Mehlodi Baloyi was convicted on four counts of rape, robbery with aggravating circumstances, and a count of theft. During the trial, the court heard that between July 2019 and October 2020, Baloyi placed a tattoo advertisement on a Facebook Page, pretending to be an artist. He is said to have lured women through social media. The victims’ ages range from 15 and 22 years old.
