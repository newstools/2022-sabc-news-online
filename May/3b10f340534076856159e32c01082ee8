The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has began a strike at ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd on Wednesday after wage negotiations broke down. The workers are demanding a 10% wage increase across the board, however the employer is offering 10%. The company said Numsa had given notice of the strike on May 9. “It was hoped that this action could be averted but this has not been possible,” ArcelorMittal said. The union threatened to disrupt the supply of steel to domestic, regional and international markets. ArcelorMittal SA is the largest steel producer in Africa, supplying over 61% of steel used in Sub-Saharan Africa. In a statement, Numsa says they have been engaging in wage talks under the auspices of the Metals and Engineering Industries Bargaining council (MEIBC) since March and they deadlocked with the employer. “We have been unable to unlock the deadlock, even though we engaged in conciliation on the 5th of May under the auspices of MEIBC’s Centre for Dispute Resolution (CDR)…At the heart of the dispute is the refusal by the bosses to make a meaningful offer to settle this round of negotiations.” Strike looms at ArcelorMittal South Africa because NUMSA has served them with a notice to strike.
