The Western Cape Premier, Alan Winde, has outlined the implications of recording incorrect population numbers, saying the province will be unable to request an adequate budget share from National Treasury. The province has a week left until its deadline to complete the Census 2022 count. While about 80% of people have been counted nationwide, just over 60% of Western Cape residents have been tallied. “So, the ultimate consequence is that we don’t have the correct numbers when we argue for budget share at national Treasury level, we don’t have correct numbers for adequate planning into where schools should be built or healthcare facilities or roads,” says Winde. So, it really is a tool that helps the citizens of the province that gives you the best number you can get. If you don’t have the number right, you don’t have the budget or plan right.” VIDEO: Western Cape government urge residents to co-operate with Census counting:  Last month Winde said a lower census population count, despite significant population growth in the province, will impact budget allocations. Winde raised the alarm that the province is lagging far behind the rest of the country in the 2022 census count. “If you are not counted, we don’t know what the numbers are and as government it’s very difficult to plan from the budgetary point of view. If we don’t get the numbers right, we might not get the right tax allocation to our province to fund education and health to make sure we have got the money for jobs and for safety and dignity for the programmes that we as government need to implement,” said Winde.
