President Cyril Ramaphosa has called for a renewed commitment to fighting corruption in memory of the late senior Intelligence official, Silumko Sokupa. The President delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Sokupa who died last week after a short illness, he was 74 years old. Sokupa was one of three members of the expert panel that was appointed by Ramaphosa to look into the July unrest in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng last year. He also served as the Deputy Director-General of the Secret Service and the National Intelligence Coordinating Committee. President Ramaphosa delivers the eulogy at funeral service for ambassador Silumko Sokupa Ramaphosa says it was Sokupa’s love for his people that bred his disappointment in State Capture… “It was out of his deep love of his people that was born his deep disappointment at the extent of corruption in our society. He saw state capture and corruption as an assault on the poor and vulnerable. He saw it as an act of counter-revolution, eroding the democratic state and stealing the resources meant to improve people’s lives. Corruption and state capture constituted the very antithesis of what he stood for: service to the people without expectation of any personal material gain. In honour of Bra Soks, we must remain resolute in our work to end corruption and state capture.” President @CyrilRamaphosa arrives at the Heartfelt Arena in Thaba Tshwane for the funeral service of the late former member of the Presidential Panels, Mr Silumko Sokupa, who passed away last week on 26 April 2022 after a short illness. #RIPSilumkoSokupa pic.twitter.com/fizWHIjB2E — Presidency | South Africa  (@PresidencyZA) May 5, 2022  Eulogy by President @CyrilRamaphosa at the funeral service of Mr Silumko Sokupa, Heartfelt Arena, Thaba Tshwane, Pretoria. https://t.co/zzg9x5rr7Y#RIPSilumkoSokupa pic.twitter.com/ak7dBXeaOR — Presidency | South Africa  (@PresidencyZA) May 5, 2022
