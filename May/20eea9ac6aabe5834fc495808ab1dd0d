A 45-year old mother from Ballito north of Durban who is charged with the murder of her four-year old daughter, is expected back in the KwaDukuza Magistrates’ Court for possible plea negotiations on Thursday. It is alleged that the woman, who may not be identified in terms of an order by the court, tied the girl’s hands and drowned her in a bucket of water last month. She allegedly told police that the child was being troublesome. The accused has remained behind bars since her arrest. The mother allegedly spent hours with the body of the child. Prior to her appearance, Magistrate Blanche van Heerden ordered the media not to take pictures of the accused and also not to identify her. The magistrate says the accused has another older child who will be severely affected if his mother is identified in the murder case. CONCERN KwaZulu-Natal Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza had said that they are disturbed by the brutal incident. Department spokesperson Mhlaba Memela says, “We are very much disturbed by the murder of the four-year-old toddler allegedly by her mother in Ballito to learn what the woman had said to the police claiming that the child was troublesome…” Memela says, “It is very shocking because there is no reason for her to throw the child in a bucket full of water and also tie her both hands, it is clear that she had planned what she did which then resulted in the child dying. We are happy the police responded swiftly and ensured the woman was arrested. We are calling on the court to ensure the woman does not get bail.”
