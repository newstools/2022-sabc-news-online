The The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) has confirmed the death in prison of the so called “Facebook rapist” Thabo Bester, who was serving his sentence in a Mangaung prison for the 2012 murder of Johannesburg model and car saleswoman Nomfundo Tyhulu. Bester is said to have perished in a fire. He was called the “Facebook rapist” as he used the social networking site to lure women to meet him, claiming that international modelling scouts were interested in them. Armed with a knife, he then raped and robbed them. Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo, says an investigation is under way to determine the cause of death. “He was discovered at about 03:35 this [Tuesday] morning, where his cell was burnt, he was found on the floor. We have since instituted a full-scale investigation. The investigations will assist us in determining what really happened, what was the cause of the fire, thus leading to the death of an inmate,” explains Nxumalo.
