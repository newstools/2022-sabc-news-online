Judgment in the bail application of the seven men accused of killing Zimbabwean national, Elvis Nyathi, is expected to be handed down on Friday, at the Randburg Magistrates Court. The suspects are accused of killing Nyathi in Diepsloot, Johannesburg, last month during unrest over crime in the area. They are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping, robbery with aggravating circumstances, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm and extortion. The state argued that the men be denied bail as they may interfere with the case by intimidating witnesses, endangering the community and tampering with evidence.

His younger brother, Miziayifani Nyathi says the family is not coping well with the tragedy. “The family is just disturbed with this whole thing. For such a thing to happen, yet, the guy didn’t do anything. So, it’s really traumatic.” According to Miziayifani, Elvis’ sin was being outside as the group was searching for everyone in the shacks. “They accused him of being outside while everyone was inside because he tried to hide behind this (place) since he’d heard these people talking about ID, passport and all that. So, that’s how they caught him.”
