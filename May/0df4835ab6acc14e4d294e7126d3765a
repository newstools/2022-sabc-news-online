Kimberley residents are up in arms over yet another water shutdown in the city. Residents will be left without water for the next three days. This is to allow the Sol Plaatje municipality to deal with maintenance issues and growing water leaks. Koena Mokoena was left without water for the past eight days. Family and friends came to his aid. The current water shutdown in Kimberley will now add to his woes. “I have been without water and the only water I have is the two 25-liters,” says Mokoena. The municipality says it has been battling to locate a valve to effect repairs. Affected residents say this persistent problem is frustrating. “It’s not fair that we are here again and the municipality is not giving clear answers,” says Andrid Scholtz, a resident. While residents are left frustrated businesses are cashing in. “We are ready for people to buy water and we even have reserves,” says Donovan Cole, General Manager: Oasis Water. The Sol Plaatje municipality says it is losing billions of litres of water due to the leakage. “We need to work on the infrastructure because we are losing billions of liters of water,” says municipal spokesperson Thoko Riet. It’s not clear how much taxpayers will cough up for the maintenance this time. No assurance was given from the municipality when water will be restored. It says water tankers will drive through all affected areas. VIDEO: Water outlets in Kimberley cashing in on municipality’s supply interruptions:
