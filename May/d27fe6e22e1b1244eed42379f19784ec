Eskom has announced that Stage 2 rolling blackouts will resume from 5pm until 10pm on Wednesday. The power utility has urged the public to continue using electricity sparingly. “A shortage of generation capacity during the evening peak will require the implementation of Stage 2 loadshedding from 17:00 until 22:00 tonight. This morning two generation units at Hendrina Power Station and one at Matimba Power Station were taken offline for repairs,” says the utility’s Spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha. Mantshantsha says electricity demands during the cold season will lead to capacity constraints’ “The onset of winter has seen increased demand and this will lead to capacity constraints throughout this period, particularly during the evening and morning peaks. Unfortunately, this would generally require the implementation of loadshedding during the evening peaks,” says Mantshantsha.  #POWERALERT1 Stage 2 loadshedding will be implemented from 17:00 – 22:00 tonight due to the failure of three
