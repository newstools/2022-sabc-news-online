Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says 80 percent of households have been counted in the province as part of Census 2022. He says Statistics South Africa has reached the milestone ahead of the deadline on Tuesday. The province was recently granted an extension to increase numbers after falling behind the rest of the country. Winde has encouraged residents to get counted over the next few days as the province is still behind the national average of 90 percent. The census count will impact on the budget allocations for services such as education and health. Slow uptake Last month, Statistician-General Risenga Maluleke decried the slow uptake of registration by households. R3.2 billion is what it will cost to carry out the Census and the results will be released in 12 months. Ntiyiso Consulting’s Miyelani Holeni says a Census is crucial because it gives an understanding of what makes up the economy with regards to the people.
