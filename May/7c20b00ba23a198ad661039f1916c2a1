Delegates at the Eastern Cape’s ninth African National Congress Provincial Conference in East London are still at loggerheads over credentials and this has delayed the conclusion of the three-day meeting. As a result, President Cyril Ramaphosa has been forced to postpone the conference’s conclusion until Monday. They are still debating whether to allow over 20 branches from the WB Rubusana region to vote. The branches took their matter to court on Saturday on an urgent basis seeking the court to allow them to participate. The court has since dismissed their case and struck it off the roll. The ANC’s national spokesperson Pule Mabe has addressed a media conference in East London, saying they cannot be in a hurry to adopt credentials. The verification process for credentials of delegates allegedly delayed: Unity, comradeship under spotlight Unity and comradeship were the buzzwords at the start of the hotly contested Eastern Cape ANC Elective Conference on Saturday. They have all nailed their colours to the mast. And those supporting Oscar Mabuyane are raising two fingers in support of his bid for a second term while those supporting Babalo Madikizela are calling for change. But as the convener in the province, Mabuyane was quick lay the rules of the game urging all in sundry to conduct themselves in a manner that will forge unity beyond the conference.
