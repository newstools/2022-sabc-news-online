Eskom says that due to the continued shortage of generation capacity, Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 5 to 10 pm throughout the week. The power utility says there may also be instances where load shedding might need to be implemented outside of these hours. Eskom is appealing to all South Africans to help limit the impact of load shedding by reducing the usage of electricity and to switch off all non-essential items.
