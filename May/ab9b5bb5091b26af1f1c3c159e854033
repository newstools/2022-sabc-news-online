A  family in Ritchie, in the Northern Cape,  is hoping that life sentence handed down to a 36-year-old man who raped their now 80-year-old relative will serve as a deterrent. Sizwe Ntwane was slapped with a life sentence by the Kimberley Regional Court for rape, assault and house breaking. Evidence that emerged in court reveals that after the rape the convicted rapist slept overnight at the victim’s home. Adelaid Mahou who is the niece of the elderly woman, says she is relieved that Ntwane will spend time behind bars for his heinous crime. “For me it’s fine, every person that rapes a person deserves a life sentence because that person has to live with that for the rest of her life. Ever since then, she is not feeling to well. She is on pain killers and ointment for the legs, sometimes she just shutdown not speaking.”
