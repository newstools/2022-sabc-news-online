The matter between AfriForum and Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and party member Mbuyiseni Ndlozi is back in the Equality Court in Johannesburg. AfriForum argues that the pair are guilty of inciting violence by singing the “Kill the Boer” song. They want sanctions to be imposed against the pair, they publicly apologise and pay for damages. Malema and Ndlozi, however, are not present in court. The lobby group is also calling for the matter to be referred to the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) for prosecution on a contempt of court charge. AfriForum alleges that both Malema and Ndlozi incited violence during the Brendin Horner murder case in Senekal, Free State in 2021. Horner, a farm manager, died after being strangled on the farm on which he worked. The state dropped the case of murder against Sekola Matlaletsa and Sekwetje Mahlamba.
