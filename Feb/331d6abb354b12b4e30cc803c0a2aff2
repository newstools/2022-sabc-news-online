Jafta Mofokeng, the 27-year-old accused of breaking into the  South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) premises in January, is expected to appear in the Bloemfontein Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. A security officer was in the control room when he saw through the security camera that there was an intruder inside the building. More security officers were called and went to investigate the apparent security breach. Mofokeng allegedly attacked the officers. He was shot and wounded during a scuffle with the guards. He was arrested on the same day and was admitted to the hospital in Bloemfontein. Free State Hawks spokesperson, Christopher Singo says he was not able to attend court proceedings due to injury. “He is expected to face allegations of burglary, trespassing, malicious damage to property, and intimidation. He was discharged today at the hospital after he was shot by the security guard during the incident which took place on the 16th of January 2022. It is alleged he tried to attack the security official who then managed to pull up his official firearm and shot him, which then lead to him not being able to attend the court proceeding as he sustains injuries during the burglary.” Video: SABC to tighten security at Bloemfontein offices [17 January 2022]
