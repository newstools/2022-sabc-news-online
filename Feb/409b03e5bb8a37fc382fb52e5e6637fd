Small businesses in the Free State say they are relieved that the National State of Disaster will soon be a thing of the past. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected many businesses. President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his State of the Nation Address last week that the end of the National State of Disaster would be announced after regulations were finalised. It has been extended for the last time until the 15th of next month. Some Bloemfontein-based business people say life has not been easy since the outbreak of the pandemic. “Actually, it was very difficult because we went through a lot. Some of our customers they left, went home; some, they lost their jobs. So, it was very difficult in the period of pandemic,” says business person. “I feel so happy because things are going to be back to normal because we lost. Many of our clients are not coming to cut because they are afraid of this sickness. So they are not coming here to the salon because of sickness we have right now,” says one hairdresser. Some residents say they are happy that the National State of Disaster has been extended for the last time. “I’m actually looking forward to it. It’s been long overdue. We have actually been losing a lot of money. I mean a lot of people have been losing business. So, now that actually everything is going to open up, we hope things will get better, back to normal and people will travel again. Just to relieve their minds and be a better South Africa again (sic),” says one resident. Calls for an end to the National State of Disaster in SA:
