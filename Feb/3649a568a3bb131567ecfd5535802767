The Gauteng Health Department has advised members of the public who need healthcare services at the Tembisa Hospital in Ekurhuleni to visit nearby health facilities. It says this is because the hospital remains inaccessible following a fatal shooting incident which has left both patients and staff in shock. The department says patients who are admitted to the facility will continue to receive care. The department says a 30-year-old police officer entered the hospital premises, called his 30-year-old partner, who was on duty at the time and asked her to meet him in the parking lot where he allegedly shot and killed the Enrolled Nursing Assistant before turning the gun on himself. “The Gauteng Department of Health would like to advise members of the public who need to access health care services at the Tembisa Hospital today to visit nearby health facilities as the hospital remains inaccessible following a fatal shooting incident that has left both patients and staff members in shock. Patients currently admitted at the facility continue to receive care. The public will be notified when the facility reopens later today,” says Motalatala Modiba, Department Spokesperson.
