A murder charge, five attempted murder and three additional robbery counts have been added to the rap sheet of three suspects arrested in connection with robbery at the Malamulele Police Station in Limpopo. The three appeared at the Malamulele Magistrate’s Court and their case was postponed to the 11th of February. They are allegedly part of a group of armed robbers who attacked the police station on the 21st of November last year. The assailants held officers hostage at gun point and robbed the station of several firearms and cash. Limpopo NPA Spokesperson Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi says the additional charges relate to ATM bombings and robberies at fuel stations in and around Bungeni that were committed on the night of the robbery at the police station. A civilian was allegedly shot dead at one of the robberies, while five others sustained serious injuries. The accused have been remanded in custody. They have acquired the services of a private attorney and are expected to apply for bail during their next appearance.
