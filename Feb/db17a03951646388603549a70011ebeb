Nestlé South Africa says it is recalling some of its Kit Kat bars due to the possibility that they may contain pieces of glass. Nestle says in a statement that it has not received any reports of complaints or injuries. It says it is taking the step as a precaution after finding small pieces of glass in quality and safety checks. The products affected are the Kit Kat Mini Bag Milk 32 by 200 grams and the Kit Kat Two Finger Milk bar 36 by 20 grams. The best before dates for both products are September 30th and October this year.
