The Director General of the World Health Organisation Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus says clinical trials to test the vaccine manufactured in South Africa for COVID-19 will start in the first quarter of this year. South Africa has been chosen as the first African country to host Africa’s vaccine manufacturing hub. Ghebreyesus and his delegation are on a two-day visit to the country to inspect the vaccine research sites. They include Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines, as well as the Biomedical Research Institute based at Stellenbosch University’s Tygerburg Medical Campus. “We expect clinical trials to start in the first quarter of this year with approval expected in 2024. Perks in other countries, as I said receiving the technology should be able to receive approval shortly thereafter, and the sparks are the same in each and almost every region already. I congratulate the region on this achievement and that we are looking forward to support you as you take this vaccine clinical campaign into clinical trials and beyond.” WHO DG Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus SA visit | WHO suggest that COVID-19 is far from over: Ghebreyesus says that the development and approval of several vaccines within a year of the COVID-19 pandemic onset, is an extraordinary scientific triumph that sets a new standard. Ghebreyesus has hailed the positive impact that vaccines have made in helping ease the stringent conditions put in place as a result of the pandemic, but in the same breath he lamented vaccine inequity. “There can be no doubt that vaccines have saved countless lives, are helping to turn the tide on the pandemic – that’s why we’re meeting in person after a long jail – and are now giving many countries the confidence to relax restrictions. But as you know, this scientific triumph, has been marred by vast inequities in access.” The full briefing:
