Grade 12 learners at Vuyolwethu High School in Kimberley say they are excited about returning to full-time learning. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga announced that schools will return to normal teaching and learning. The Northern Cape Education Department says the only hiccup for them is space at some schools. Grade 12 learners, Nomsa Magugwama and Keabetswe Ramosie, say the COVID-19 pandemic had a severe impact on their schooling system. “My experience hasn’t been so well because most of the chapters that we would do in class I wouldn’t understand, because we are so behind with our schooling and most of the things we did not cover, because of the short time that we had to spend in class. Maybe for a week, we would come for a day or two to school.” “I think things will work out much more easier for us, because we would go more into detail with our topics and chapters and help us a lot, because with COVID-19 it didn’t help us a lot, and now I think it will be much more better for the learners as a whole to go more into detail with our topics.” Education Expert welcomes Basic Education decision on full-time learning Education Expert, Professor Sarah Gravett, has welcomed the announcement that schools are prepared for learners’ full-time return to classrooms from today. Gravett says some challenges remain. “I do think it is great news that all our children are back to school every day. The last two years have been very difficult and devastating for learning, particularly, in the early years of schooling where it is very clear that there was research conducted that there was significant learning loss. So it is definitely good news but the issues that were mentioned in terms of overcrowding, difficulties with infrastructure, of course, remains a concern.” Professor Sara Gravett on whether South Africa is ready for a full return to daily schooling:
