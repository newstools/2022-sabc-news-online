The University of KwaZulu-Natal’s Howard campus in Durban has been closed indefinitely. This was after large groups of people stormed the gates, threatening the safety of staff and students. The university suspended its academic programme for a week on Monday following violent protests. There have been student demands that campuses be opened for the registration of students. Registration is being done online since the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic. UKZN Spokesperson, Normah Zondo, has condemned what she called attempts to destabilise the university. “The University of KwaZulu-Natal has decided to shut down the Howard College campus. This decision was taken as large groups of individuals have gathered outside the Gate 1. This means that no one will be allowed to enter the campus. This applies to all individuals including staff and students that are in possession of university access permits and also includes returning and new students who would be coming to campus for residence purposes. Returning and new students who are returning to campus to take up residence are advised to remain at home until further notice,” says Zondo.
