The City of Tshwane says it will cost at least R10 billion  to address road infrastructure issues in the metro. Many roads across Tshwane are in a bad condition, with the recent heavy rainfall worsening the situation. Transport Member of the Mayoral Committee (MMC), Dikeledi Selowa says the city has partnered with the provincial government to assist with road repairs and maintenance. Selowa was speaking at the Gauteng Department of Transport’s Smart Mobility weekend campaign in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria. “The amount of roads in Tshwane that need to be built, resurfaced, and reconstructed is about 6500 kilometres of road that need to be essentially done in the city of Tshwane which will cost us roughly about R10 billion. Tshwane took over Kungwini, Bronkhorspruit and Hammanskraal,” says Selowa. Selowa say the metro took over a couple of collapsed municipalities. “So essentially what you had was municipalities such as Kungiwni and Bronkhorstpruit which had completely collapsed included in the metro, meaning the budget you had firstly now needed to be included in the larger parts of the city,” adds Selowa.
