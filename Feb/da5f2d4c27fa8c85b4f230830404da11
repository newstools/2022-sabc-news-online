The Mthatha Specialised Commercial Crimes Court has sentenced Siyambonga Mhlakaza to 18-years’ imprisonment for money laundering and 81 counts of fraud. Mhlakaza siphoned R1.2 million from the Walter Sisulu University in the Eastern Cape. He pleaded guilty to being part of a scam that diverted cash meant for financially disadvantaged students and salaries of academic staff to his bank accounts. Regional Spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority, Luxolo Tyali says the accused admitted to having been part of a scam. “He admitted having been part of a scam that saw allowances for financially needy students and even salaries of academic staff diverted in his bank accounts, and that lead some students dropping out of the university.” Meanwhile, the Polokwane High Court in Limpopo has reserved judgement in the matter between engineering company Mphaphuli Holdings and the SIU. Judge Gerrit Muller informed attorneys representing the SIU and businessman Lufuno Mphaphuli’s firm that he needed time to consider the merits of the case. Mphaphuli Holdings asked the court to review the recommendations made by the SIU when it investigated the company. The investigation eventually led to the termination of Mphaphuli’s multi-million contract with the Ferakgomo-Tubatse Municipality in 2013. The company was meant to electrify villages around Burgersfort. Mphaphuli’s lawyer, Ishmael Maemetja says they expect a favourable outcome. “The client is happy we presented the matter. He is happy. He is just waiting for the outcome which hopefully will favour us. I am sure, as soon as possible, the secretary of the judge will call us. The matter is awaiting judgement from the judge and we are anticipating that it will be in our favour.”
