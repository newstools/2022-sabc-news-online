The bail application of one of the three siblings who allegedly murdered two South African Municipal Workers’ Union (SAMWU) leaders in Limpopo three years ago will resume in the Thohoyandou Magistrate’s Court on Monday. Ndivhuwo, Percy and Simon Radzuma and Thabo Sibanze allegedly shot and killed Timson Musetsho and Ronald Mani, in two separate incidents in Thohoyandou. Musetsho and Mani were critical of the R300-million deposit that Vhembe District Municipality made in the defunct VBS Mutual Bank. Percy Radzuma’s bail application which is based on new evidence, started last Monday. It was postponed last Friday for arguments by the state and his defense on whether his new evidence is satisfactory enough for him to be released on bail. He told the court that he wants to be released on bail citing that he needs to be treated by his traditional healer as he is sick. Percy’s siblings Ndivhuwo and Simon abandoned their bail application last year. Their other co-accused, Thabo Sibanze, abandoned his bid for bail two years ago.
