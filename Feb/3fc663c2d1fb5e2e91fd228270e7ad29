A taxi blockade in the vicinity of the Vanguard Drive near Mitchell’s Plain has caused traffic disruption and commuters being stranded in Cape Town. The city’s Member of the Mayoral Committee for Urban Mobility, Rob Quintas, says several officials from various agencies have been deployed to the scene. A meeting has also been scheduled for later on Tuesday to establish the cause of the taxi blockade. “It’s understood at this stage that the blockade is as a result of taxi drivers protesting alleged extortion by large taxi organisations. We’re uncertain of the exact details at this stage, however safety and security and safety and traffic personnel are on the scene, and we have been informed that the South African police service are calling an urgent meeting with all parties later today to discuss the impasse,” says Quintas. Meanwhile, a taxi boss has been killed at a garage in Verulam north of Durban. KwaZulu-Natal Police Spokesperson Nqobile Gwala says officers are investigating a murder case. “A case of murder is being investigated by the Verulam SAPS. It is alleged that on the 14th of February at 18:45 a 40-year-old man was shot by unknown suspects while in his car in Verulam. He sustained multiple gun shot wounds to his body and was declared dead at the scene. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated.”
