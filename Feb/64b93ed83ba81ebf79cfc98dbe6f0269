President Cyril Ramaphosa says electricity constraints are a threat to economic and social development. The president delivered the State of the Nation Address at the Cape Town City Hall. He says although the country has benefited from a stable economic framework and strong commodity prices, the economy is being held backwards by unreliable electricity supply, inefficient network and high cost of doing business. “The problems in the South African economy are deep and they are also structural and when electricity supply cannot be guaranteed. When our railways and ports are inefficient and innovation is held back by spectrum, when water quality deteriorates in our municipalities and where we live companies are reluctant to invest and the economy cannot function properly,” says Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa says load shedding (blackouts) continues to hamper business and communities. He says South Africa has a shortfall of 4 0000 megawatts of electricity. He says government is taking necessary steps to bring additional generation capacity to bridge the electricity shortfall.
