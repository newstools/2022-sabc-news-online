The Executive Director at St Anne’s Women’s Shelter in Woodstock in Cape Town, Joy Lange, says she was uninspired by President Cyril Ramaphosa’s State of the Nation Address on Thursday night. Lange says she had hoped that the president would announce an increase in funding for shelters as the money they currently receive is not enough to provide adequate services to survivors of gender-based violence. In his speech, Ramaphosa made mention of three new pieces of legislation which aimed at strengthening the criminal justice system, promote accountability across the state and support survivors. Lange says funds must be allocated to where they are needed the most. He says, “I am very disappointed that issues around gender-based violence and femicide was addressed at about 20h40 only when the state of the nation address started at 7. That tells us where the issue of GBV lies where this government is concerned. The people on the ground are suffering. The funds are not being channelled to where it is needed.” President Cyril Ramaphosa’s speech: GBV and Femicide Response Fund Last year,  Ramaphosa said processes were put in place to ensure the GBV and Femicide Response Fund will be managed in an ethical and transparent manner. He was addressing the launch of the private sector-led fund at the time which is aimed at supporting the implementation of the National Strategic Plan (NSP) and the wider GBVF response in the country. Ramaphosa said the launch of the fund fulfilled the promise made to women and children during a summit held on the issue in 2018, to end the scourge of violence and killing of women and girls in our country.
