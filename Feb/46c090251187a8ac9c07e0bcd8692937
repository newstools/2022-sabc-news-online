Gunfire and explosions went off in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu in the early hours of Wednesday as Al Shabaab militants attacked police stations and security check points, the internal security minister said. Al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab, which aims to topple the central government frequently carries out attacks against the government, including attacking a minibus carrying election delegates last week. “The terrorists attacked the suburbs of Mogadishu and targeted our police stations and check points,” Abdullahi Nor, the minister, wrote on Twitter. “Our security defeated the enemy.” There were no immediate details on casualties. Police would provide more details on the attacks, the minister said. There was no immediate comment from Al Shabaab.
