The General Council of the Bar (GCB) says Advocate Dali Mpofu has brought the advocates’ profession and the administration of Justice into disrepute. The organisation says it wants Mpofu to be removed from the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) and be replaced. It says this follows Mpofu’s behaviour during the interviews for the post of Chief Justice. There has been public displeasure on Mpofu’s line of questioning specifically of the Supreme Court of Appeal President, Mandisa Maya and Judge President Dustan Mlambo. GCB Chairperson Craig Watt-Pringle says they are extremely disappointed with how Mpofu conducted himself during the public interviews. Watt-Pringle says, “It is my view and widely held view that Mpofu seemed to be walking in step with Malema and with one or other two commissioners as well, And Mr Malema mission is political in nature, but Mr Malema is not our baby Mr Mpofu is, he was put the by the GCB on the basis that he represents the profession not on the basis that he would behave in this way towards highly respected judges.” Judge expresses misgivings over Malema, Mpofu participation Last week, former Constitutional Court Judge and Director of Freedom Under Law Johan Kriegler expressed misgivings over the participation of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and Mpofu in the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) panel interviews for the next Chief Justice. Kriegler said the two have a cloud over their heads and therefore should not be part of what he terms a quality control process for the country’s top judge. “In the case of Mr Malema, a parliamentary ethics committee found him guilty of abusing his position at the JSC to further his personal position and not the public position which is a serious breach of his duty as a member of the JSC that is still hanging.” VIDEO: JSC responds to criticism about Chief Justice interview process:
