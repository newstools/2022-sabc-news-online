Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi is expected to meet with parents at Hoerskool Jan Viljoen in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg on Tuesday. This follows allegations of racism at the school. It is believed a violent altercation between black and white learners broke out at the school last Friday. On Monday, police fired rubber bullets to disperse angry parents who had charged at officers’ cars and the school gates after accusing the provincial Education Department of not dealing with their complaints. Allegations of sexual misconduct which Lesufi has described as disturbing have also been levelled against one of the teachers. Addressing parents outside the school gate, he said, “I want to plead with you, let us not teach our children violence. I want to assure you [that] this matter is receiving our immediate attention. There is no one who will hide it, postpone it or disguise it. We are dealing with racism, that’s it nothing else but racism.” The department says it will ask the South African Human Rights Commission to investigate the complaints.
