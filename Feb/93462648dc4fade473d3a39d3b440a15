The Correctional Services Department says it is reviewing the arbitrator’s ruling with regard to KwaZulu-Natal Regional Commissioner, Mnikelwa Nxele. Nxele remains suspended despite the General Public Service Sector Bargaining Council’s decision to dismiss the misconduct charges against him. He was suspended in 2019. He was dismissed after being implicated in the State Capture Commission in Parktown, Johannesburg for allegedly receiving monthly bribes of about R57 000. Correctional Services Spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo says, “The Department of Correctional Services (DCS) reaffirms the continued suspension of the KwaZulu-Natal Regional Commissioner, Mr Mnikelwa Nxele. This decision has already been communicated to Mr Nxele and his legal representative. This action is unavoidable as DCS is reviewing the award unjustly granted by the GPSSBC on 7 February 2022.” No response In 2020,  Nxele said he had not received any response from the Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola after asking him in a letter to intervene and resolve the impasse between him and the National Commissioner, Arthur Fraser. He said he wanted the minister to facilitate his return to work as soon as possible. Nxele was prevented from returning to work by officials of the Correctional Services Department. He was suspended three times by the department but contends that various institutions set it aside. While Nxele believed he deserved to go back to work, he said it was impossible as he had not received any response from the minister. He contends that he was suspended for allegedly exposing corruption and irregularities within the department in the Public Service Commission. In the video below, Nxele was first suspended in 2019:
