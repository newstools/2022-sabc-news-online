The African National Congress (ANC) in Mpumalanga has suspended the Mayor, Council Speaker and Chief Whip at the Msukaligwa Municipality in Ermelo. It is alleged that the three were seconded to the council on a temporary basis after the party found discrepancies with the ANC list ahead of the November elections. Mayor Babekiwe Mahlalela, Speaker Vuyiswa Madini and the Chief Whip Samkelo Buthelezi allegedly refused to vacate their positions as agreed. Mpumalanga ANC Acting Secretary, Lindiwe Ntshalintshali says the three were advised to vacate the positions but they refused. She says they will be subjected to the party’s disciplinary hearing. Mahlalela, Madini and Buthelezi are the latest ANC members who allegedly defied the party when advised to vacate their positions. Ntshalintshali says members should toe the party line. She says, “We want to confirm that as the PEC of Mpumalanga that we take a decision that these members, the Troika, should be suspended. They defied the caucus position. They defied the PEC and NEC because those mayors and speakers are sitting there. There’s no NEC decision that has appointed them. There’s that tendency of defiance and to say they are elected by people, they don’t account to the ANC.” North West Last year, the ANC in the North West served a suspension letter on the only member who failed to step aside.
