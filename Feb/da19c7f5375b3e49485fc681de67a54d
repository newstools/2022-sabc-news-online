The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) has accused the African National Congress-led government of trying to manipulate the appointment of the new Chief Justice in South Africa. This, as the Judicial Services Commission (JSC), just wrapped up the process of conducting interviews for the next Chief Justice, as per the request by President Cyril Ramaphosa. The party has described as “shocking, unethical and deplorable” the revelations in between the interviewing process, that, there was an exchange of letters and phone calls between Justice and Correctional Services Minister, Ronald Lamola and Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. JSC Interviews I Justice Raymond Zondo concludes a 12 hour hot interview:  EFF National Spokesperson, Vuyani Pambo says, Lamola revealed this exchange in which he sought to influence the appointment of acting judge for the Constitutional Court in favour of Judge Justine Mlambo, who is also vowing for the top job at the Constitutional Court. Pambo says the EFF will file a complaint against Justice Zondo to the JSC, so that he can be held accountable. “We can no longer turn a blind eye on this bias and unethical conduct. We cannot act like judges are not captured by politicians due to their ambitions for judicial promotions. The EFF will file a complaint against Zondo with the JSC for referral to the Judicial Conduct Committee, so that he is held accountable. We call on the dismissal of Minister Lamola from cabinet for what is clearly a successful and unethical act to have Judge Mlambo appointed as acting judge of the Constitutional Court.”
