Eskom CEO Andre De Ruyter says the utility will not implement rolling blackouts, or load shedding, this evening after it managed to recover generating capacity at a number of power plants. The power utility has announced some reprieve for electricity users, saying that it has recovered sufficient generating capacity to avoid implementing more load-shedding on Tuesday evening. Eskom CEO André de Ruyter says the utility has about 4000 megawatts less in unplanned outages than on Monday. The utility was forced to implement Stage 2 rolling blackouts for eight hours on Monday evening. De Ruyter says things look better today. “It is pleasing that we are able to communicate to you that we do not have load shedding tonight, subject to any unforeseen events and that the system has recovered quite well, thanks to our generation colleagues at work.” De Ruyter was also quick to point that there no gaurantees as to how long the lights would remain on, pointing out that “this is a dynamic environment in which we operate. Things do happen.” Eskom briefing on the national power grid:
