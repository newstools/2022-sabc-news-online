Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen says President Cyril Ramaphosa’s stance on the economy is not coming from the DA’s manifesto but from its track record where it is governing. Steenhuisen reiterated that Ramaphosa’s speech comes directly from the DA’s playbook. The President drew mixed reactions when he told the nation last week that job creation was the responsibility of the private sector. He said the government’s role was to provide the conditions for businesses to grow and generate jobs. Steehhuisen was the second Speaker in the joint Sona Debate. “None of the things you appropriated from the DA came from a wish list. They are things we already do where we are in government. And so, you did not borrow from the DA’s manifesto.  You took directly from the DA’s track record and that’s a good thing and it’s also a very important distinction to make, one may try to understand why this economy under your government remains in quicksand.” The SONA Debate is continuing the City Hall SONA Debate | Malema says ‘so-called new dawn’ is riddled with massive unemployment,increased violence Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema says the unemployment rate in South Africa is the highest under President Cyril Ramaphosa’s leadership.
