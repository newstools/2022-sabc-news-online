The case against alleged Parliament arsonist, Zandile Mafe, has been postponed to the 25th of March for further investigation at the Cape Town Magistrates’ Court. The State applied for the postponement. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson, Eric Ntabazalila says more arrests are possible.  Meanwhile, EFF leader Julius Malema says negligence was the main cause of the recent fire that gutted the National Assembly buildings at Parliament. He says Mafe’s arrest is being used as a scapegoat to divert attention from government’s negligence. “Do you think in your rightful mind, a person would burn Parliament and then goes and sleep next to where you have committed a crime… there’s no such thing. So I think more than anything guys, it’s negligence. They’ve not maintained Parliament, you may find out the rats have eaten the cables, that why it started burning from the roof and there was a spark and that spark caused the fire,” Malema says. Malema says negligence was the main cause of the fire:  AZAPO members call for the immediate release of Mafe Members of the Azanian People’s Organisation (AZAPO) have called for his immediate release. Azapo spokesperson Gaontebale Nodoba says, “You have seen citizens of South Africa, that they are clutching at straws. All of a sudden in a democratic South Africa, the first person to be charged with terrorism-related acts is a  poor black homeless person. What a shame to this so-called quasi democracy. How can it be that coming from Apartheid from 1994, we get into a so-called democracy and the first person to be charged with terrorism-related acts is a poor black person.”
