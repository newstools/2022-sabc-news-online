A fire has been reported in another building in the Durban CBD on the corner of Beatrice and Grey streets. This is the second structural fire this week after 14 shops were damaged when a fire broke out in a storage facility on AB Xuma Street in the city centre. The incidents come shortly after the China Mall Emporium in the city was destroyed by fire last month. At least 13 people were treated for minor and moderate injuries, as firefighters battled the blaze. The video below reports on Durban business counting the cost of the China Mall fire:  Emer-G-Med paramedic spokesperson Kyle van Reneen says in the latest fire “Emer-G-Med paramedics together with eThekwini fire and rescue services responded to a scene of a structural fire in the corner of Beatrice and Grey streets in the Durban Central Business District after smoke was seen coming out from one of the stores on the corner”. “Reports from the scene are that the fire was contained, thanks to the swift action from the eThekwini fire and rescue services and that no serious injuries were reported,” adds Van Reneen.
