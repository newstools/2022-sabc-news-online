They would then claim cash amounts and share them among themselves. The suspects were arrested by the Provincial Anti-Corruption Investigation Unit and National Intervention Unit after police picked up discrepancies in fuel transactions. North West Police Spokesperson, Colonel Amanda Funane says, “It was later established that some of the claims were processed while the vehicles were at the SAPS garage for repairs. Subsequent to these irregularities, investigations were conducted and led to the arrest of these members aged between 43 and 56.” Police say two petrol attendants, who were part of the scheme, were also arrested. They have since agreed to testify on behalf of the state. According to Funani, the suspects will be suspended in order for internal departmental investigations to be conducted. “A suspension will be considered by the management. There is a process that needs to be followed. After the process has been followed the management will make a decision of suspending them.” The accused are expected back in court on the 14th of March.
