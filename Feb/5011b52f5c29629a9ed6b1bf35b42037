The taxi association (Santaco) in the Eastern Cape has suspended the total shutdown that was scheduled for Monday in the province. The taxi industry in the province announced on Friday that it would suspend its services and embark on a strike, due to the nonpayment of scholar transport operators by the provincial transport department. The department said it had set aside R73 million to settle the invoices and it was sourcing more funds from Treasury. Speaking at a media briefing in Mthatha, provincial Santaco Chairperson, Zola Yolelo, said they decided to suspend the strike after meeting with Premier Oscar Mabuyane. “We met with the premier and he promised to ensure that everyone owed will be paid within seven days. We have since sent a report to the people who sent us and they agree that we should suspend the strike. Without mentioning any figures, but we know that some of us have not been paid for a period of two years, some for one year six months, while others haven’t received payments for three months.” Eastern Cape Bus Council Secretary, Manelisi Siguqa says they will resume the strike if Premier Mabuyane does not fulfill his promise. “This is not a promise but a commitment. If we are not paid within the seven days we agreed upon with the premier, we will not sit by for any more discussions again. So, many promises were made by previous leaders and we will not listen to any promises now.”
