Parents at Malale, outside Musina in Limpopo, say their children have not been going to school for the past three weeks due to lack of scholar transport. The village does not have a school, and learners travel for more than 44 kilometers schools at Madimbo and Domboni villages. The Department of Education says the they are still processing application by service providers. Parents says they fear that their children might loose interest in education if they do not return to school soon. Learners says they are behind with school work. They are appealing to the Department of Education to speed up the processes of appointing a service provider for scholar transport. “We are behind with school. That’s why we need help. The scholar transport is a problem. The department must device other means. We are suffering everyday because of this busses,” says one learner. Scholar transport problems force Malale Village pupils to miss school:

Director at Department of Education Matamela Matanga says the delay in appointing transport providers in Malale village has been caused by roadworthy tests that the vehicles must undergo before transporting learners. “The delay are the requirements that all learner transport must go for vehicle fitness and roadworthiness and must also be tested on Natis. That is not entirely in our control (but it is) something that we are dealing with, (with) our sister department, the Department of Transport.” Matanga has promised the processes will be completed this week. Meanwhile, learners and parents took to the streets and blockaded the busy R525 between Bokmakeer and the Kruger National Park. They hope the protest will highlight their plight and end the lack for transport learners.
