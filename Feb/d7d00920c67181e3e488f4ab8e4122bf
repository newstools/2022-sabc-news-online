The National Education, Health and Allied Workers’ Union (Nehawu) has approached the Labour Court to try and force the African National Congress (ANC) to pay all outstanding salaries owed to its members and staff employed by the party. It’s emerged that the labour union filed the papers at the Labour Court on Monday. Nehawu is accusing the ruling party of failure to honour numerous commitments to pay salaries and contribute to the worker’s Provident Fund, the UIF and to the Medical Aid Scheme on time. It says its members and the rest of the staff continue to lose their assets due to late payments of salaries. On the video below, ANC staff members brief media on the non-payment of their salaries:  Nehawu says it plans to intensify the campaigns against the ANC and will consolidate effort to push the employer to accede to the demands of their members and workers. In January, it was reported that the preparations leading up to the ANC National Conference in December this year had stalled, according to ANC staffers who are currently on a stay away from their jobs. The staffers who have not been paid for three months held a virtual press briefing to air their grievances. The staffers said that the party’s leadership had shown a lack of commitment to resolving their labour issues which include the late and non-payment of some salaries, as well as the party not contributing to their medical aid and provident funds.
