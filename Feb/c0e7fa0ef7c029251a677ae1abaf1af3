Vaccinology Professor Shabir Madhi says he fully supports the move by government to further relax the COVID-19 lockdown regulations. The decision comes after the sitting of a special Cabinet meeting on Monday, following the country’s official exiting from the fourth wave of infections. The meeting was preceded by the meetings of the National Coronavirus Command Council and the Presidential Coordinating Council. Minister in the Presidency Mondli Gungubele says a number of changes to the Adjusted Alert Level One Lockdown include reducing the isolation period from ten to seven days. Madhi says there must be a change in mindset on what the country is trying to achieve. He says, “We are in a very different phase of the pandemic and with more than 70% facing the Omicron wave, 80 % of South Africans have immunity which protects them against severe disease. We’re no longer trying to prevent infection, that has passed us by a long time ago. And in South Africa, coupled with the vaccine roll-out we have protection against severe disease.” INFOGRAPHIC: COVID-19 statistics in SA: SOURCE: Department of Health  & ﻿National Institute of Communicable Diseases  CASES GAUTENG WESTERN CAPE KWAZULU-NATAL EASTERN CAPE FREE STATE LIMPOPO NORTH WEST MPUMALANGA NORTHERN CAPE 643 076 341 091 150 865 16 312 4 254 DEATHS 7 423 20 438 15 803 4 475 2 516 86163 186 225 628 478 197 000 01 FEBRUARY 2022 3 608 307 95 288 22 303 586 3 459 418 3 085 23 Total Vaccination 29 957 898 21 526 185 258 2 541 107 067  Free State  North West  Gauteng  Mpumalanga  Northern Cape Eastern Cape  Limpopo  KwaZulu-Natal Western Cape sabcnews.com | SABC News Channel | SABC Radio News | SABC News ﻿App 1 169 247 (function(d){var js, id="pikto-embed-js", ref=d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if (d.getElementById(id)) { return;}js=d.createElement("script"); js.id=id; js.async=true;js.src="https://create.piktochart.com/assets/embedding/embed.js";ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document)); National state of disaster Last week, some medical experts added their voices to calls to end the national state of disaster, which was declared in March 2020, by President Cyril Ramaphosa, to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic. They say most of the measures in place are simply unfit to deal with where South Africa is right now in the fight against the coronavirus. Madhi says, “We are in a very different phase of the pandemic and the dynamics of the pandemic have changed. The dynamics of our ability to protect ourselves against severe disease and death has changed completely.” “Despite the modest rollout of COVID-19 vaccines in South Africa, more than three-quarters of the population before the omicron wave already developed natural infection [and] induced immunity which is protecting extremely well against severe disease and death. It will likely continue protecting us even when there is another resurgence, which will probably take place in a few months,” says Madhi. Professor Shabir Madhi was interviewed last week:
