Western Cape Premier Alan Winde says the provincial government has referred complainants in a matter involving suspended Community Safety Minister Albert Fritz to a non-governmental organisation. The NGO is dedicated to helping victims of alleged sexual misconduct. Winde confirmed on Sunday that the allegations against Fritz were of a sexual nature. He says it’s important that the complainants have an independent support system that includes taking up the matter with the police. Winde says he’ll await the completion of an external and independent probe before deciding on the way forward in relation to Fritz’s position in the provincial Cabinet. He’s encouraged the complainants to lay charges with the police. Fritz has also since stepped aside as the Democratic Alliance provincial leader. In the Facebook post below, Winde outlines details on the matter regarding Fritz:  ANC to lay charges Meanwhile, the African National Cingress (ANC) in the province says it will open a criminal case against Fritz.
