The Commission of Inquiry Into State Capture says it will deliver to President Cyril Ramaphosa part three of its Report at the end of February 2022. The report is likely to run into about 1500 pages and will be about the size of volumes that made Part 1 and Part 2 which were delivered at the end of December and January 2022. By the end of February, the Report that the Commission will have delivered to the President will run into about 3000 pages of evidence, findings, and recommendations. The expected report at the end of February will not be the last part of the Report. The Commission will apply to the High Court, Pretoria for a further extension of its term by a period of two months. This means that, if the extension is granted, the Commission will submit the balance of its report either at the end of April or part of it at the end of March and the last part at the end of April 2022.
