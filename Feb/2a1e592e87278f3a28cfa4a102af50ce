Zungula says he hopes this is not meant to influence the outcome of the appointment of a new Chief Justice. Zondo has already delivered the first and second parts of the report and the third one was to be delivered at the end of this month.

Now that its work is completed, we see another trend of reports being delayed when it comes to being issues to the public. We hope this is not the manner upon which the Acting Chief Justice is trying to influence the sitting President as Chief Justice of the country (sic).” State Capture Report | Second report focuses on Denel and Transnet:
