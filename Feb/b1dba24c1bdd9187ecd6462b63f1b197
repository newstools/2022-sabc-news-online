Action SA has announced the resignation of two of its councilors from the City of Johannesburg. John Moodey and Advocate Gillian Benson will end their term of office at the end of February. The party says the pair is going to focus on Action SA’s plan for the 2024 election.
“Following an enormous successful breakaway this past weekend, Action SA agreed that the work of consolidating all our structures across all nine provinces requires all hands on deck. Therefore John Moody, in his capacity as Action SA provincial Chairperson, will focus all his efforts in supporting all our structures across Gauteng,” says Action SA Spokesperson Lerato Ngobeni.  This morning, two of our councillors in Joburg who are also members of the ActionSA Senate, @JohnMoodeyGP & @GillianYoungBe1 have tendered their letters of resignation in order to to focus on ActionSA’s 2024 Project.https://t.co/dPIeGaQE9W — ActionSA (@Action4SA) February 14, 2022
