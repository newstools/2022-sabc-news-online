The Durban Magistrates Court has heard that four more rape charges have been added to the charge sheet of an alleged serial rapist. Up to now, the accused faced only two charges relating to rapes committed in Isipingo, in the south of Durban, last year. Police earlier said they believe the 50-year old accused was responsible for 17 other rape cases dating as far back as 2008. The accused allegedly lured his victims from Durban to a bushy area of Isipingo. The accused was expected to make a formal bail application today, but defence attorney Ayanda Mkhwanazi asked for a postponement after the court was told of the new charges. This comes after the police held an identification parade. The case has been postponed to the 18th of February for an opposed bail application. #sabcnews #sabckzn The Durban Magistrate court has heard that four more rape charges have been added to the charge sheet of an alleged serial rapist.
