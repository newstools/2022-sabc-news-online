Security has been heightened at the Estcourt Magistrate Court in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands where the trial of former uMkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus is set to begin. At the Estcourt Magistrate Court now. That trumped-up farcical COVID-19 case against me is about to proceed … pic.twitter.com/fxROxc7qU7 — Carl Niehaus (@niehaus_carl) February 17, 2022  Members of the police’s public order policing unit have been deployed in and around the court. There are a few supporters of Niehaus in court. Niehaus is being charged with contravening COVID-19 regulations during a gathering outside the Estcourt prison in July last year. He is accused of having mobilised a gathering outside the Estcourt prison where former President Jacob Zuma was incarcerated for contempt of court. After his arrest, Niehaus was asked to pay a R3 000 fine but he opted to go to trial. VIDEO: Carl Niehaus arrested outside Estcourt prison during a SABC interview: On Twitter, Niehaus says, “ They’re hell-bent to get me into jail. I will not be intimidated nor silenced!” I’m up against this today: Trumped-up COVID-19 charges abused for persecution. Mxm, the State prosecutor wants me sentenced to 6 months imprisonment, without the option of a fine. They’re hell-bent to get me into jail. I will not be intimidated nor silenced! A LUTA CONTINUA! pic.twitter.com/JvKjZT17o7 — Carl Niehaus (@niehaus_carl) February 17, 2022
