Eskom has announced that rolling blackouts have been suspended due to sufficient recovery in generation capacity. The power utility says rolling blackouts assisted in replenishing the emergency generation reserves for the week ahead. From Saturday morning, Eskom teams have returned nine generating units to service, helping to ease the capacity constraints. In a statement, Eskom said a generating unit at Hendrona, Majuba and two units each at Kriel and Matimba power as well and three Kusile units returned to service. However, five other units have not returned to service from failure to ease capacity constraints. Eskom says it expects to return some of these and more generating units during the course of the coming week. Eskom thanked South Africans for their tolerance and understanding during the rolling blackouts.
