Police Minister Bheki Cele has accused Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema and National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole of plotting to have him fired. Cele made the accusation during his contribution to the SONA debate. Several opposition parties raised concerns that Cele remained a minister despite the damning findings against him in the report on the unrest in July last year. “Honourable Malema, on the 10th of December 2020 there was a meeting between yourself and the National Commission to plot that I must be chased so I’m not surprised that today this is happening. He has all the rights to make the suggestion, but what I don’t like is being patronised. If you don’t want me as a minister don’t put me in other places. It’s not your duty,” says Cele.

Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, John Steenhuisen has told President Cyril Ramaphosa that they will help him to fire his Cabinet if he can’t do it. He told the House that Ramaphosa had failed to take action against some Cabinet ministers who are failing in their duties. Steenhuisen says, “Accountability is something you only talk about, because actually doing something would mean firing some of your Cabinet and upsetting your comrades. So, here is what is going to happen Mr President, because you have shown that you are a president of talk and not a President of action, we are going to make it easier for you. “Today, I’ve tabled of motion of no confidence, not in you but in your whole cabinet in terms of  section 102 (1) of the constitution. If it’s not possible for you to do right by the people of South Africa, we are going to take the burden off your hands and let this House fire them for you,” he adds. VIDEO: Debate on SONA 2022:
