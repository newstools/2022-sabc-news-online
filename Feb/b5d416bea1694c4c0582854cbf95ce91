Police in the Karoo region of the Western Cape have nabbed a truck driver and confiscated drugs worth an estimated street value of R4 million on the N1 near Laingsburg. Police Spokesperson Chris Spies says officers spotted and pulled over a suspicious-looking truck. After searching it, they found more than 295 kilogrammes of dagga and 31 000 Mandrax tablets concealed on the trailer of the vehicle. They confiscated the consignment and subsequently arrested the driver on a charge of dealing in drugs. The vehicle had been travelling from Johannesburg to Cape Town. A 45-year-old suspect has appeared in the Laingsburg Magistrate’s Court and he’s remanded in custody pending his bail application next week.
