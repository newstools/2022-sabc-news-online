Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader, Julius Malema says the unemployment rate in South Africa is the highest under President Cyril Ramaphosa’s leadership. He was participating in the Joint State of the Nation Address (SONA) Debate on Monday afternoon at the  City Hall in Cape Town. Malema told Ramaphosa that he has served his dream of becoming a President and it was time for him to go. “Why are you not leaving us in peace because the highest ambition you ever had was to become a President. You have become a president. Now you want to come and serve for a second term. To do what? Because you are not doing anything. You are just on top but doing nothing on top. What  became so-called new dawn, has become massive unemployment, increased violence against women and children, collapsing hospitals, and the greatest threats against the security of  the state in the post-democratic South Africa.” EFF leader Julius Malema responds to Sona:  Steenhuisen s says Job creation Democratic Alliance leader John Steenhuisen says President Cyril Ramaphosa’s stance on the economy is not coming from the DA’s manifesto but from its track record where it is governing. Steenhuisen reiterated that Ramaphosa’s speech comes directly from the DA’s playbook. The President drew mixed reactions when he told the nation last week that job creation was the responsibility of the private sector. He said the government’s role was to provide the conditions for businesses to grow and generate jobs. Steehhuisen was the second Speaker in the joint Sona Debate. “None of the things you appropriated from the DA came from a wish list. They are things we already do where we are in government. And so, you did not borrow from the DA’s manifesto.  You took directly from the DA’s track record and that’s a good thing and it’s also a very important distinction to make, one may try to understand why this economy under your government remains in quicksand.”
