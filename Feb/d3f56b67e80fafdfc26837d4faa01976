Acting Judge Stuart Wilson has expressed disappointment that the state has asked for another postponement in the Tshegofatso Pule murder trial. The state said they wanted to call one of the police officers who downloaded WhatsApp messages to the stand. However, that witness will only be available on Thursday. Wilson said he could have been informed over the weekend that one of the witnesses would not be available today, so he can attend to other criminal matters on the court roll. Earlier, defense lawyer, Norman Makhubela re-cross examined Tshepiso Tsita, who was the first witness to testify two weeks ago. Makhubela says the day Tshegofatso received threatening SMS’s instructing her to stay away from Shoba, she and the accused had gone to the doctor for a scan. Tsita could not comment on that doctor visit. Makhubela also says the couple also went to go buy clothes for the baby prior to her death. The trial is expected to continue on Thursday.
