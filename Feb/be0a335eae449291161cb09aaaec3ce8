The United Nations Secretary General has expressed concerns about reports of increased ceasefire violations, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Monday and urged the use of diplomacy amid fears of a Russian invasion in Ukraine. “We are particularly concerned regarding reports of civilian casualties, targeting of civilian infrastructure and evacuations. We underline or call for an immediate cessation of hostilities, maximum restraint and for all parties to avoid any action and statements that would escalate tensions further. All issues must be addressed through diplomacy,” Dujarric said. His remarks came as President Vladimir Putin railed against Ukraine in a televised address on Monday, saying that neo-Nazis were on the rise, oligarchic clans were rife and that the ex-Soviet country was a US colony with a puppet regime. Earlier in the day, Putin told France’s and Germany’s leaders during phone calls on Monday that he planned to sign a decree recognising the two breakaway regions of Ukraine as independent entities shortly. Washington says Russia has massed a force numbering 169 000-190 000 troops in the region, including the rebels in the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk- collectively known as the Donbass – and could invade within days. Russia denies any plan to attack its neighbor but has threatened unspecified “military-technical” action unless it receives sweeping security guarantees, including a promise that Ukraine will never join NATO.
