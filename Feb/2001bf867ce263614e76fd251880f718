The pre-trial of former Free State Premier Ace Magashule, businessman Edwin Sodi and others continues in Bloemfontein High Court on Tuesday morning. On Monday, Magashule made an appearance where all the logistics for a trial were ironed out. A few members of the ANC, who are supporters of Magashule were outside of the court on Monday, a far less number than what was expected. Magashule says this trial is politically motivated and is a complete waste of time. NPA is wasting our time, this is a political trial: Ace Magashule <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Meanwhile, Olly Mlamleli, former mayor of Mangaung Metro Municipality in the Free State has reiterated that she has never stolen any public money ever since she has been in office. She says this pre-trial involving Magashule seeks to purge them for no apparent reason. Mlamleli is claiming that the step-aside resolution of the ANC is selective. However, she is also not a stranger to the courts, as she is also facing charges of fraud and corruption related to the Asbestos project. She was ousted as a Mayor in August 2020 during a vote of no confidence wherein members of the ANC in the council voted with the Democratic Alliance (DA), Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the Freedom Front Plus to remove her via a secret ballot.
