The Tshegofatso Pule murder trial has adjourned till Tuesday 8 February at the South Gauteng High Court in Johannesburg. Ntuthuko Shoba has been accused of being the mastermind behind Pule’s murder. Shoba’s defense has asked for a state witness to be called back to the stand. Defense lawyer Norman Makhubela wanted state witness Tshepiso Tsita to be recalled. Tsita, a friend of Pule, was the first witness to testify in court. She testified about messages Pule received from a person posing as a recruitment agent, telling her about a make-up artist position. In the text, Pule was asked to go to a McDonald’s outlet, south of Johannesburg, where a Jeep would be waiting for her, to take her to the interview venue. Pule didn’t go. Convicted murderer Muzi Malepane confirmed that the interview was staged for the 29th of May 2020, the day Pule was meant to be killed, allegedly on Shoba’s instructions. The trial will continue on Tuesday.
