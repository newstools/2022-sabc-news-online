A mass funeral for the nine learners who perished in a crash between Mayflower and Dundonald last week will be held on Thursday at the Mayflower sports ground in Mpumalanga. The nine learners were on their way home when the minibus they were travelling in lost control and overturned killing all nine learners. Spokesperson for Mpumalanga’s Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, Moeti Mmusi, says all families will be assisted with burial arrangements. “A joint funeral service for the nine learners who passed away following an accident on the 16th of February on the D267 road will be held on Thursday in Mayflower. Following the interventions by government, several departments have since provided the required support to the affected families and schools. Among others, ongoing psychological counseling is being rendered to families, learners and educators,” says Moeti.
