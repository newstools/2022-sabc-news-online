The Ramotse Primary School in Luka village near Rustenburg was on fire on Saturday night. Provincial education spokesperson, Elias Malindi says the cause of the fire is still not known at this stage, but the community suspects criminal activity. North West provincial education authorities have condemned the incident.  “The fire destroyed the computer lab with 40 computers, photocopiers, printers, maths lab with one projector. One screen manipulative cupboard, interactive board, and 18 tables. Also, food for the learners and the stationary for the learners got destroyed and the block of toilets for the girls and boys,” says Malindi. Last month, parents and learners of the Tirelong Secondary School marched to the N4 saying they will blockade the road until the Education Department provides learners with mobile classrooms. The school was badly vandalised over the December holidays and the department made alternative arrangements for learners. This arrangement would see the learners attending three farm schools in the area. Tirelong Secondary School, which consists of 430 learners from Grade 8 to 12, was built and donated by Kroondal Platinum Mine in 2010. Over the last two years, the school has been a target of vandalism. During the December holidays, it was targeted again and roofs, window panes, taps and all electronic equipment were taken. The school currently has no running water or electricity and the provincial education department was forced to intervene.
