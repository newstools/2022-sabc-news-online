Online classifieds have dominated the internet for the past 10 years, affording sellers a chance to make extra money on the side while allowing buyers to purchase secondhand goods at a bargain. But online scams remain the biggest challenge facing this industry. Online classifieds are a popular marketplace for ordinary consumers where buyers meet sellers. The service is affordable with minimum requirements for sellers to advertise their services or goods. It gives sellers a chance to make extra cash by selling secondhand goods. But the platform is also a space that is dominated by scammers and fraudsters. “It’s always a saving good value that people are looking for or hard to find stuff that they can’t get elsewhere or sellers the opportunity to turn stuff that they don’t use into cash and we want to help sellers sell quickly and buyers find what they’re looking for and to close those deals. When we look at the category the biggest barriers aim around lack of trust and fears around security in dealing with strangers,” says Director-General at Gumtree South Africa Claire Cobbledick. In the video below,  National Consumer Commission spokesperson Phetho Ntaba shares online shopping tips:  Consumers are advised to take extra precautions when making a transaction with strangers. “Our recommendation tends to be more towards cash but of course, if you note to say you need to choose a location that you would be making your deal, be very careful because carrying cash is not risk-free as well and so our recommendation is a public space.” Online classifieds OLX has closed down its website in South Africa earlier this month. The group says this was to allow it to fully focus on its property and motor vehicle platforms, Auto Trader and Property 24.
