Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has announced that he will get the South African Human Rights Council to investigate issues of human rights violations at the Hoërskool Jan Viljoen. During his interaction with the pupils at the school, it also came that there were issues of sexual misconduct leveled against one of the teachers, which Lesufi has described as disturbing. Lamenting that there were girls who didn’t feel safe at the school, Lesufi assured them that the allegations of sexual misconduct would get his immediate attention. Lesufi met with the leadership and learners of Hoërskool Jan Viljoen in Randfontein west of Johannesburg to determine the cause of last Friday’s alleged racially-motivated incident. He says he will meet with them again soon. Earlier, police used rubber bullets to disperse some parents and learners who accuse the provincial government of not listening to them following the incident. Parents protest outside Hoerskool Jan Viljoen:  It is alleged that a violent altercation between black and white learners broke out at the school. Lesufi addressed parents outside the school gate. “I want to plead with you, let us not teach our children violence. I want to assure you [that] this matter is receiving our immediate attention.
