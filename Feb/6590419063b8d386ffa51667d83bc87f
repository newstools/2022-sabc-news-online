The National Prosecuting Authority says it is confident that it has water-tight case against alleged Parliament arsonist Zandile Mafe. On Friday, the Cape Town Regional Court denied him bail. Mafe is charged with crimes including arson over a devastating fire at Parliament in Cape Town last month. He has denied the charges. The defence team says it will appeal the court’s decision that there were no compelling circumstances for Mafe’s release on bail. He was arrested shortly after Parliament was set alight. Mafe remains in custody at Pollsmoor Prison after his defence applied to the High Court for his discharge from Valkenberg Psychiatric hospital. His lawyer, Luvuyo Godla says they will draft correspondence. “Now in my office, we will quickly draft correspondence, to transcribe  the recording on an urgent basis and we will approach the High Court and appeal the matter on an urgent basis. This is our instruction from Mr Mafe.” NPA welcomes court’s decision The NPA has welcomed the decision of the Cape Town Regional Court to deny alleged Parliament arsonist, Zandile Christmas Mafe bail.
