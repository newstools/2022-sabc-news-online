Eskom says it avoided implementing more rolling blackouts on Tuesday evening after recovering sufficient generating capacity. During a media briefing on Tuesday, Eskom CEO André de Ruyter said the utility had about 4 000 megawatts less in unplanned outages than on Monday. The utility was forced to implement Stage 2 rolling blackouts for eight hours on Monday evening, after losing around 2 000 megawatts of capacity due to trips and breakdowns during the day. De Ruyter says that the situation is now looking up.
