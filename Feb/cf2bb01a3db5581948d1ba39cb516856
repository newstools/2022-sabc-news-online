The former mayor of Nelson Mandela Bay and former senior DA member, Athol Trollip has joined ActionSA. He was welcomed to the party in Gqeberha by party leader, Herman Mashaba. Trollip comes in as the Eastern Cape Chairperson for Action SA. He retired from Politics in 2019 while still a member of the DA. He says his new political trajectory stems from an urge to see change. “All previous initiatives have not been good enough to dislodge the ANC. The definition of madness is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. I’m prepared to try something new to change the political landscape in the Eastern Cape,” says Trollip. Mashaba welcomed Trollip, marking it as a big win for the party. “I think under the leadership of Trollip, we can reclaim and regain the pride of the Eastern Cape, having him as our provincial chairperson. Athol, thank you so much for accepting this huge responsibility,” says Mashaba. VIDEO: ActionSA welcomes Athol Trollip in Gqeberha
