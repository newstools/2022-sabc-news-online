As the country awaits President Cyril Ramaphosa’s  State of The Nation Address on Thursday evening, many South Africans are waiting eagerly to hear which issues the president will highlight in his speech. The increasing unemployment rate, poverty, crime and strengthening the economy are some topics that people have raised as burning issues that Ramaphosa should have a clear plan on. He will deliver the address at the Cape Town City Hall. The venue was chosen after a fire gutted the National Assembly and Old Assembly buildings last month. The address comes as the country is still battling to curb the spread of the coronavirus which has led to over 96 000 deaths and has negatively impacted the local tourism economy as well as lead to job losses.
