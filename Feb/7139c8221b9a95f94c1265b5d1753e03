British nationals who choose to stay in Ukraine should not expect a military evacuation if conflict with Russia ensues, Junior Defence Minister James Heappey told Sky News on Saturday. “British nationals should leave Ukraine immediately by any means possible and they should not expect, as they saw in the summer with Afghanistan, that there would be any possibility of a military evacuation,” he said. On Friday, the UK government advised British nationals to leave Ukraine now while commercial means were still available and advised against all further travel to the country.
