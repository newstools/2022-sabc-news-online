The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) is there for the country, its neighbours and the continent in times of uncertainty, crisis and very real danger according to President Cyril Ramaphosa. He was paying tribute to South Africa’s men and women in uniform during the celebrations of Armed Forces Day in Mbombela, Mpumalanga. Ramaphosa has lauded the SANDF for its role in battling the insurgency currently taking place in the north of Mozambique. “These brave men and women are there to restore stability and prevent a spill-over of the conflict into other countries in our region. Last month we welcomed back the members of the 15 SA Infantry Battalion from their deployment to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Since 2001, members of the SANDF have been part of peacekeeping operations under the UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the DRC, known as MONUSCO,” says  Ramaphosa. VIDEO: Armed Forces Day
