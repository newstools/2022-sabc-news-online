The DA in Gauteng has welcomed the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC)’s National Investigative Hearing into the province’s leg of the July 2021 Unrest. The hearings are set to continue until the 4th of March in Sandton, north of Johannesburg. The KwaZulu-Natal hearings were held shortly after the July violent unrest that left scores of businesses looted, infrastructure damaged and more than 300 people killed in both provinces. DA’s Solly Msimanga says someone should be held accountable. “The hearings will be to really go deep into what happened during the 2021 July unrest, that has seen KZN and parts of Gauteng being shaken. We’ve seen massive looting that has taken place; lives that have been shattered; livelihoods that have been brought to an abrupt stop. And we want to ask where was government in all of this? We want people to be held accountable. Where was minister Cele, Ayanda Dlodlo doing when these things were happening?” SA Unrest | Recovering from July 2021 unrest and looting – Soweto:
