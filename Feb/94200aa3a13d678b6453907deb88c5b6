An unemployed family of five from Nobumba village outside Peddie in the Eastern Cape has taken it upon itself to counter rising unemployment in their community. They have put together their R350 social relief grants to start a poultry enterprise. Becoming entrepreneurs was their only option to overcome poverty. Their business is doing well, and they sell about 200 chickens a month. Now they want to grow their business and create opportunities for other young people in the area. Phumlisa Ngabase is a member of the co-op, and says any form of support is welcome. “Our plan is to grow this project so anybody who is watching this video we want he or she to help so that we may help decrease the crime.” The provincial government is committed to supporting youth-centred agricultural initiatives. The spokesperson for the Department of Agrarian Reform, Mvusiwekhaya Sicwetsha, says they have invested in this initiative since last year. “We started supporting them in the 2020/2021 financial year and also in the current financial year where the MEC went to the business supported them with machines, broiler chickens, broiler feed and water tank.  Now the MEC said she wanted to see young people taking up opportunities in the agriculture sector and she’s doing this that the programs and policies of government to help young people.” The chicken farmers already have their eye on the commercial market with a plan to produce birds on a large scale.
