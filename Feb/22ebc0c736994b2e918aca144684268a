The High Court in Johannesburg will hear testimony from African Literature scholar Professor Elizabeth Gunner in the case between the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and lobby group AfriForum. EFF leader Julius Malema on Thursday stood by his belief that the singing of struggle songs played no role in farm attacks. However, the lobby group argues that the singing of the song incites violence and contributes to the increase in farm attacks. On his second day of giving evidence, Malema said singing the song did not have the same impact as giving a command. Malema says, “It is white people who must be ashamed of what they have done to us. You cannot turn tables now and want to blame me for the crimes committed by white people. We don’t give a command from singing. When it is time to give the command, we’ll give that command.” “A black child’s trauma is not a trauma. We are still a traumatised nation if you don’t know. The land has not been returned into the hands of the rightful owners. For as long as you are in possession of a stolen car, you remain a criminal,” says Malema. EFF leader Julius Malema denies struggle songs incite violence:

In that case the Supreme Court of Appeals issued an order preventing Malema from singing similar songs. The ‘Hate Speech’ case against Malema stems from a complaint lodged by Afriforum in October 2020 after supporters of the EFF sang ‘Kill the Boer’ outside the Magistrate Court in Senekal. In a statement, Afriforums Head of Policy and Action Ernst Roets said that AfriForum asked for an order that Malema, Mbuyiseni Ndlozi and the EFF have committed hate speech, that they must apologise publicly and that they must pay a fine to an organisation that strives to combat hate speech.” Day 2 | Malema testifies in the Afriforum hate speech case:
