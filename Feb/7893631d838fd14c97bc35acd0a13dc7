Ntuthuko Shoba’s defence has put forward a discharge application in the High Court in Johannesburg. Shoba is facing murder, conspiracy to murder and defeating the ends of justice charges for the murder of Tshegofatso Pule. Pule was eight months pregnant when she was murdered in June 2020. Defence lawyer Norman Makhubela says the state doesn’t have a water-tight case. Makhubela has applied for a discharge saying there is no reliable evidence that the accused committed the offense. He says the state relied on convicted murder Muzikayise Malephane who he says is not a credible witness. The defence lawyer also says the cyber related evidence is inconclusive. Makhubela poked holes at the way the investigation was handled, saying Pule received messages on her phone, one threats and the other for a job interview, however the police did not check who those numbers belonged to. He also says police did not find the phone with the disputed number. In the video below, Muzikayise Malephane admits to being paid R70 000 for the hit:
