Parents of learners from Ramotse Primary School, at Luka near Rustenburg in the North West, have called for tough action against anyone involved in the burning of some parts of the school building. Residents say they woke up to a blaze at the school around midnight on Saturday. They suspect that the building was set on fire by criminals. Study materials were burnt in the process. A lab with 40 computers, a photocopying machine, printers, a room with food for learners, stationery and textbooks, have been destroyed. On parent says, “I’m hurt. My feelings are hurt. Like, we don’t know what to do. As parents, who are here, we are very disappointed.” Another parent says, “We hope that going forward, there will be security at schools, so that children can learn in a secure space.” The North West Education Department says teaching and learning has resumed because no classrooms were burnt. Education Spokesperson, Elias Malindi says, “We can indicate that today, learning and teaching is unfolding normally at the school, but under very, very difficult circumstances. Because it is difficult for teachers to provide learners with papers, any other reading material. However, we are working with the nearby schools to ensure that teaching and learning continues normally at that particular school.” The department says a case of arson has been opened. Last year November, some blocks at Tshikombani Primary School in Nzhelele, near Louis Trichardt, were gutted by a raging fire. Foul play has been alleged in some quarters. However, the actual cause hasn’t yet been established. VIDEO: Tshikombani Primary School in Limpopo gutted by a raging fire:
