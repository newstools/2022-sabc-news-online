Travellers to Botswana will from Monday need to produce proof of being fully vaccinated to gain entry to the country. Gaborone has announced updated requirements. Citizens and foreign visitors will need to prove they received a full regimen of COVID-19 vaccines in order to be granted access at any port of entry into Botswana. Unvaccinated people remain barred from visiting Botswana. Botswana’s government says fully vaccinated persons will no longer need to have a negative PCR test in order to enter. Those who are due for booster shots must get them in order to be considered as fully vaccinated person. Those who haven’t will be required to provide a negative PCR test. Travellers who test positive will need to quarantine at their own costs. Unvaccinated persons must be willing to be vaccinated at the port of entry they’ve at or face deportation. Returning citizens who are unwilling to get the jab face a fine of R6 500, imprisonment for a year or both.
