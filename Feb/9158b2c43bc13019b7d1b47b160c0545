Eskom has announced that Stage 2 blackouts will be implemented from 11am on Wednesday until 5pm next Monday. The power utility says it recently utilised significant amounts of emergency generating reserves, which have now been depleted. Eskom Spokesperson Sikhonathi Mantshantsha says, “Eskom regrets to inform the public that Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 11:00 this morning until 05:00 on Monday. This load shedding is necessary due to a shortage of generation capacity following breakdowns of two more generating units during the night.” “Since the weekend Eskom has utilised significant amounts of emergency generating reserves, which have now been depleted and need to be replenished. Eskom will use this period of load shedding to replenish the emergency generation reserves,” Mantshantsha adds. Below is the full statement: In its submission to the National Energy Regulator on the request for tariff increases in January, Eskom assured South Africans that there are no plans for blackouts in the near future. The power utility further stated that the requested hikes are not meant to recover monies lost through corruption or blackouts. According to a study done by Eskom, the country suffered a R35-billion loss in economic damage, over a period of 12-years, due to the blackouts.
