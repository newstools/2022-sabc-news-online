The South African Weather Service has issued a warning of severe thunderstorms and heavy rain in several provinces from Friday that will continue into the weekend. It says localised or flash flooding could affect road travel as would reduced visibility on the roads. Forecaster Mbavhi Maliage says this weekend’s rain is not related to the tropical cyclone Batsirai, which hit Mauritius and Madagascar earlier this week. She says it’s too early to determine if the cyclone will affect South Africa. “For today, there are some alerts that have been issued out for rainfall. Most of this rainfall will be for the Eastern Cape, North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng and Limpopo. KZN can expect widespread showers and rainfall, but mostly scattered into the northern parts with the alert expected to start this afternoon around 1-2 pm.” SA Weather Forecast | Friday, 04 February 2022:
