A teacher from a school in Dundee in KwaZulu-Natal appeared briefly in court for allegedly sexually assaulting a 14-year old learner on the school premises on Friday. The teacher is set to be back in court on February 28 for a formal bail application. It is alleged that the teacher called the girl to a storeroom offering to help her with school work, where he sexually assaulted her. Provincial Education Department spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi says the teacher has been suspended. Mahlambi says, “We are told that also the police are doing their cause in terms of arresting him obviously he will get subjected to disciplinary action by the Department of Education because we want our schools to get free of this kind of acts and we want our learners both boys and girls to go to school to a safe environment as it were.” #sapsHQ Decrease in some of the sexual offences, especially rape cases attributed to all provinces increasing their GBV awareness campaigns, including meetings with SAPS and communities.#SAPS also ramped up sensitisation on GBV crimes through media. #CrimeStats NP pic.twitter.com/yhLCNADLvX — SA Police Service  (@SAPoliceService) February 18, 2022
