A Health Department hearing is due to begin on Friday after an appeal was brought against the approval of COVID-9 vaccines for children. The Free the Children, Save the Nation non-profit organisation is challenging a decision by the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) to approve the use of COVID-19 vaccines on children aged between 12 and 17. The Chairperson of the Appeal Committee, Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi says, “An organisation known as Free the Children is challenging the decision of SAHPRA. The question is what is the degree to which children in those ages are exposed to, the risk of contracting COVID-19 and whether or not that risk justifies the administration of these vaccines.” “According to SAHPRA, there is enough justification. According to the appellants, they argue that since there is very little evidence available, there is no justification for SAHPRA to permit the administration of the vaccines to young children or adolescents.” Parents angry over government’s decision to vaccinate children without parental consent: COVID-19 vaccination for children aged between 12 and 17 started in October, 2021:
