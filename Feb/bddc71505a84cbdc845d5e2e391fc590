Police Minister Bheki Cele is calling on political parties to play their part in diffusing political tensions. Cele was addressing the media on behalf of the Inter – Ministerial Committee looking into political killings in KwaZulu-Natal. The briefing comes as four wards in the province are holding by-elections. Of these wards, three were left vacant after the councillor candidates were killed. Last week, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) National Council member and Speaker of the AmaJuba District Municipality – Reginald Bhekumndeni Ndima was shot and killed outside his home in Newcastle. Cele notes which parties have been among the most affected by political killings. “Most of the new cases were reported before, during and after the Local Government Elections in November 2021. Investigations of the political killings Task Team have revealed that the most affected political parties are the ANC, IFP and NFP. Motives for these crimes are linked to intra-political conflicts with a few cases linked to various motives, such as Taxi Violence and other domestic related issues,” says Cele. Cele says since 2018, the task team has made over 280 arrests on politically related cases in the province, with a 63 percent conviction rate. “Since 2018, the task team has investigated 258 dockets – this is 32 more dockets compared to the last update in June 2021, with a 54% detection rate and 33% court rate and an 63% conviction rate,” Cele added.
