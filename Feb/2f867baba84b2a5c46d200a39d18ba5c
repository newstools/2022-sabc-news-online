Eskom says its power system is under severe pressure and has appealed to people to switch off all unnecessary lights, the geyser, pool pump, and non-essential appliances. Eskom last subjected the country to blackouts almost two weeks ago. Eskom has been battling to keep the lights on in recent years because of poor maintenance as well as underperforming new power stations, Kusile and Medupi. There are hopes that Independent Power Producers may be able to alleviate the situation with additional solar and wind power projects in the coming years. #PowerAlert 17 February 202217:00 Our power system is under severe pressure.
