Legal expert, Riaan Louw says the terror-accused Thulsie twins are expected to only be eligible for parole after serving half of their remaining sentence. Tony-Lee and Brandon-Lee Thulsie were sentenced to eleven and eight years respectively by the High Court in Johannesburg after entering into a plea agreement with the state. Five years and seven months will be deducted from their sentences for time already served. They were arrested in July 2016 for allegedly plotting a series of attacks on Jewish targets and the US Embassy. Police arrested them after Tony-Lee allegedly discussed plans with an undercover United States FBI agent between May and June 2016. “Normally, if a person is sentenced to 10 years, normally, he basically has to serve half of his sentence before he is eligible for parole. Now in this case where the judge took off the period and made an order where that the time they spent will be taken off their sentence, it means basically that they will have to do half of what their remaining sentence is before they will be eligible for parole.” Video: A look at the Thulsie twins case
