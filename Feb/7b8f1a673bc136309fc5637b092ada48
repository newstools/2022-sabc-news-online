Cameroon has confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu in its West region, the government said. The H5N1 diagnosis followed a significant number of bird deaths at a poultry farm in Kongso, in the area of Bamoungoum, said a statement by the regional governor dated on Sunday. Culling is underway and a sanitary barrier will be erected around the farm. Epidemiological investigations will be done in all poultry farms and markets in the region, the statement said.
