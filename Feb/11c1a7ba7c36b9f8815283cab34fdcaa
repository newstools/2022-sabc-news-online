A former professor of Constitutional Law at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, Karthy Govender, says the damage has already been done to the image of Judge President of the Gauteng High Court Division, Dunstan Mlambo. This after Mlambo was asked about rumours of sexual harassment allegations against him during the Judicial Service Commission interviews for the position of the country’s chief justice in Sandton, Johannesburg on Thursday. The JSC will expunge all the questions and answers on sexual harassment from the records of the proceedings on Mlambo’s interview. JSC Commissioner Dali Mpofu asked Mlambo to clarify the sexual harassment allegations and reminded him that it was an impeachable offence – if it was true. Commissioners Julius Malema and Nosiviwe Mapisa Nqakula also asked follow-up questions. When the JSC resumed after a break, it was decided that the rumour would not be entertained. Govender says, “The people sitting on the Judicial Service Commission are meant to appoint the best candidate to lead our judiciary. The concern that one has is that some of these questions are aimed at other objectives either hurting the reputation of a candidate or being controversial for the purpose of being controversial. I think that detracts considerably from the responsibilities of the commission.” Chief Justice nominee Dunstan Mlambo denies allegations of sexual harassment Mlambo denied allegations of sexual harassment. He describes it as poisonous rumour. “There is no substance to the rumour. It’s a rumour and I think it’s a poisonous rumour. There is actually no substance to it. I was actually shocked when I heard about it. And I was actually hoping that someone would come up and say I’m one of those who was sexually harassed by Judge President. So, it’s unfortunate that people are using people’s names willy-nilly in spreading rumours of this nature. There is completely no substance to that rumour.” JSC Interview | Judge President Dunstan Mlambo – Part2
