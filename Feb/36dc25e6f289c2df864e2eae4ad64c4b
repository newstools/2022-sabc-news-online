KwaZulu-Natal police are investigating two cases of murder after two bodies were found in a sugar cane field at Verulam, north of Durban. It’s alleged that the two men were driving from Inanda towards Verulam when unknown suspects in a vehicle overtook them and opened fire. Police say the vehicle veered off the road into the sugar cane field. “A vehicle was found in the sugar cane field with bullet holes inside the sugar cane fields police found two bodies of males believed to be in their 20s with multiple gunshot wounds to the body. Both victims were certified dead at the scene. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” says Nqobile Gwala, Police spokesperson. Meanwhile, the family of late ANC Branch Secretary in Ward 82 at Umlazi, south of Durban, believe his murder is politically motivated. Thulani Shusha was gunned down last night near his home in the evening at W. Section at Umlazi. Shusha was shot as he was returning from a branch meeting. The uncle of the deceased Themba Mkhize says they are devastated. “I am devastated with the death of Thulani as he liked ANC in such way that he sometimes couldn’t attend family meetings. It is painful today that he is no more. But he liked ANC.”
