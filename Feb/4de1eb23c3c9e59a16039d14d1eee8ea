The Department of Public Works and Infrastructure has appointed the Coega Development Corporation (CDC) to assess the damage to the fire-ravaged buildings of Parliament. The scope of work also states the CDC must provide professional advice on the safety of the structures and provide measures to make the structure temporarily safe to allow the investigations to proceed unhindered. The CDC must also submit a secondary detailed assessment report to indicate the extent of the damage and the residual strength of the structure. The CEO of the CDC, Khwezi Tiya says they are humbled by the confidence placed in the CDC to work on such an important symbol of our constitutional democracy. “We accept the responsibility with the greatest of humility and recognise the hard work that lies ahead of us. We will certainly execute our responsibility with the utmost of professionalism and diligence working together with all relevant stakeholders.” The detailed assessment report must also include restorative measures with associated cost comparisons for restoration, the proposed estimate of the rehabilitation project and cost and long term restorative measures.
