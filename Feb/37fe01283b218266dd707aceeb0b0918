He maintains that the decreased support in last year’s municipal elections paints a bleak picture for the upcoming 2024 national elections. Months after the Local Government Elections, the ANC in the Northern Cape is still licking its wounds. The party received 50.55% support during the 2021 municipal elections, a decline from the 58.26% support in 2016. Saul says unless something changes, they must forget about leading the province in 2024. “There are only about 165 000 that have voted for the ANC and this poses a particular challenge to the movement. If we go to 2024 with this trend, it’s most likely that I am the last serving ANC Premier in the Northern Cape,” says Saul. In the meantime, Saul says they have plans to strengthen local government to deliver basic services and respond to the dissatisfaction of residents. “We need to strengthen our capacity to give support to our municipalities to make sure that they are responsive to service delivery challenges. As soon as a municipality fails, people direct their anger to the provincial government.” As the party embarks on its two-day Lekgotla, Saul has told delegates to find ways of dealing with the disunity and making the party attractive to the voter once again.  Northern Cape ANC Chairperson frowns upon internal battles of the party Saul says internal battles within the party make it unattractive to voters and supporters. He says the provincial ANC lekgotla should find ways in dealing with the disunity within the party as they prepare for the 2024 elections.
