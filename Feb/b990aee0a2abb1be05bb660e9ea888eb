A tussle for traditional leadership of Bakgatla ba Kgafela at Moruleng, near Rustenburg in the North West, is seemingly far from over. A group in the royal family has selected their preferred traditional leader, whom they say will be inaugurated next week. This is despite the fact that Ramono Pilane Lenchwe is still recognised as the acting chief, appointed after being recommended by kgosi-kgolo Kgafela Kgafela and the traditional council. The Tshomankane Royal family say they don’t recognise both Ramono Pilane Lenchwe and Kgafela Kgafela because they are from Mochudi, in Botswana. Dr Justice Peloakgosi of the Tshomankane Royal Family explains. “He was acting for six months. He was just acting Kgosi. We are going to take over the offices in Moruleng. We will definitely govern through normal, proper traditional council from all the villages, 32 villages. And we must emphasize that, because it is important for bakgatla, to know what is happening,” says Peloakgosi.
