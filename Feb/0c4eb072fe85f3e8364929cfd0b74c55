The Competition Commission says investigations have found that drugmaker Roche had allegedly overpriced a breast cancer treatment drug, Trastuzumab. The Commission has referred the matter to the Competition Tribunal for a hearing. It says the conduct is in contravention of the Competition Act and in violation of human rights. According to the commission, the alleged violation took place in both the private and public sectors in South Africa. It says investigations revealed the conduct took place between 2011 to 2020. The commission estimates that over 10 000 breast cancer patients were denied access to the treatment drug because of its high cost. Commission spokesperson Siya Makunga says, “The Commission has today (Tuesday) filed a referral with the Competition Tribunal for the prosecution of Switzerland-based Roche Holding for alleged overpricing of breast cancer treatment drug, Trastuzumab. The Commission’s referral alleges that the excessive price of Trastuzumab is a violation of basic human rights including the right of access to healthcare as it denies access to life-saving medicine for women living with breast cancer.” Press Release: @CompComSA prosecutes a multinational healthcare company, Roche, for excessive pricing of a breast cancer treatment drug pic.twitter.com/m1Qh7bbr0d — CompComSA (@CompComSA) February 8, 2022
