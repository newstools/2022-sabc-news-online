Ramaphosa made the handover during the Opening Session of the AU’s 34th Ordinary Session of the Assembly. He says, “It is now my honour to hand over the chairmanship of the Committee of the African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change to His Excellency President Macky Sall of Senegal. I thank you all.” VIDEO: President Cyril Ramaphosa addresses the 35th Ordinary Session virtually: Climate change While participating in a meeting of the AU Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change on the margins of the AU Summit, Ramaphosa says it is imperative that Africa does not lose momentum, and that climate change is not relegated to the periphery of the global development agenda. He says, “Africa is experiencing the worst impacts of phenomena associated with global warming such as droughts, floods and cyclones.  Climate change impacts are costing African economies between 3 and 5% of their GDP’s.” Ramahosa says it is with pride that they can say that Africa spoke with one voice at COP26 in Glasgow late last year. “The conclusion of the Paris Agreement Work Programme will provide a basis for Parties to implement fully the Paris Agreement, in the context of a Just Transition and Sustainable Development, and leaving no one left behind… As we prepare for the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change #COP27 taking place in Egypt in November, Africa must once more speak with one voice, expressing their unwavering support for the implementation of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement,” he adds.
