The African National Congress (ANC) in the Nelson Mandela Bay region in the Eastern Cape says the party is struggling to make sense of the murder of Councillor Mzwandile Booi. The Nelson Mandela Bay Ward 20 councillor was shot dead in his car in Gqeberha while driving home on Sunday night. Chairperson of the region, Babalwa Lobishe, says they are appealing to the community to come forward with information to help solve the murder. “So, it can’t be that the same people that have just been voted in are at risk among the same people that have put them in those positions. So, we are appealing to our communities to protect our councillors and support them throughout their tenure,” adds Lobishe. Earlier, the ANC in the province expressed shock at the attempted murder of its Ward 42 branch leader, Mazwi Mini. The ANC says in a statement it is aware that a threat was made against Mini during a branch meeting a week ago, warning him about his behaviour and preference in the run-up to the provincial conference. ANC Provincial Secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi has urged ANC members to prevent rogue and criminal elements from hijacking party processes. Two shots were fired into Mini’s house in Kwanobuhle on Saturday night, wounding him in the jaw. Regional Spokesperson of the ANC, Lukhanyo Mzinzi, says they don’t want to speculate on the motive of the shooting. “We want to allow space to the police to investigate. We don’t want to predict an outcome. We are surprised. We note this with a very fine eye. We recently went to a congress and there was no violence – a congress that was highly contested but there was no violence. We want to denounce this [violence],” says Mzinzi.
