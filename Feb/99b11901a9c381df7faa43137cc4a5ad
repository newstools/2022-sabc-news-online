The National Joint Operational and Intelligence Structure (Natjoints) which comprises the Police, the Defence Force and the State Security Agency say they are on high alert to ensure that the State of the National Address (SONA) takes place safely. In a statement, the Natjoints warned that any action aimed at disrupting SONA or contravening the law will not be tolerated.
