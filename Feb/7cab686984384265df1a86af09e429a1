The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) will begin its National Investigative Hearings into the Gauteng leg of the July 2021 unrest on Monday. The hearings are set to continue until March 4, 2022, in Sandton north of Johannesburg. The KwaZulu-Natal hearings were held shortly after the July violent unrest that left scores of businesses looted and infrastructure damaged, with more than 300 people killed in both provinces. The unrest is purported to have been incited by groups of people alleged to be former President Jacob Zuma’s supporters who took to the streets to protest his incarceration. SAHRC spokesperson Gushwell Brooks says, “It’s two weeks, hearing from 21 February 2022. It will be focussed on finishing the testimonies from the KwaZulu-Natal leg of the hearings. After that, the focus will be largely on the Gauteng province.” “The first week will be dedicated to the government as well as the state officials, as well as community representatives. The second week is anticipated to focus on the inputs by journalists as well as by academics and other members of society,” added Brooks.
