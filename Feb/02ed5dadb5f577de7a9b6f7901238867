The Judicial Service Commission (JSC) will on Tuesday morning begin interviews for the position of the country’s new Chief Justice. Former Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng retired in October last year, after a non-renewal tenure. This led to the beginning of a lengthy process to select the most suitable person to serve at the helm of the highest court in the land. Four candidates were shortlisted and will be interviewed this week. In an unprecedented move, President Cyril Ramaphosa called on the public to nominate candidates for the next Chief Justice. An independent panel vetted the 500 nominations and listed eight candidates. This was submitted to the President who shortlisted four candidates who will now be interviewed. The four senior judges are Constitutional Court Judge Mbuyiseli Madlanga, Supreme Court of Appeal President Mandisa Maya, Gauteng High Court Judge President Dunstan Mlambo and Acting Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Judge Madlanga is the first to be interviewed in Sandton on Tuesday morning, with Deputy President of the Supreme Court of Appeal Xola Petse presiding over proceedings.
