The murder trial of the four police officers accused of fatally shooting Mthokozisi Ntumba during a #FeesMustFall protest in Braamfontein in March last year, is expected to resume in the High Court in Johannesburg on Monday morning. Tshepiso Kekana, Motseothata Boitumelo, Madimeja Lekgodi and Victor Mohammed are facing four charges including murder. The 35-year-old father of two was killed when officers allegedly opened fire on a group of students outside a TVET college. Last week, a former student, Siphesihle Mtsweni, who was shot and wounded allegedly by the police during the protest, told the court he had dropped out of college in November due to the trauma he had suffered after the incident. All the accused have pleaded not guilty. Last month, Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) investigator Judy Twala told the High Court how police drove off after Ntumba was shot. She also testified that the officers hadn’t recorded the incident when it occurred. However, the officer’s attorneys disputed Twala’s evidence that their clients did not report the incident. There were also claims by defence lawyers that evidence at the scene could have been tampered with.
