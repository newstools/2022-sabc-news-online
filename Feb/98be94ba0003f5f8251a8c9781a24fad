The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) will on Thursday announce the introduction of online payments on the NaTIS online booking system. This new development is designed to enhance online vehicle license renewals and bookings to create a seamless booking experience when using online booking services. These developments form part of measures designed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where government has imposed strict regulations to curb the spread by encouraging members of the public to avoid crowded areas and maintain social distancing. “The intention is to increase the convenience of the public, making it easy to transact with us particularly when it comes to matters of licensing of vehicles and driving licenses. So the launch will take place on Thursday in Johannesburg. So people will from home be able to renew their licenses and they will be able to choose if they want it delivered to their homes or places of residence for a small extra fee,” says Simon Zwane, RTMC Spokesperson. #OnlinePayment #AtYourDoorStep pic.twitter.com/zTrVEYCt7R — Road Traffic Management Corporation (@TrafficRTMC) February 14, 2022    88820
