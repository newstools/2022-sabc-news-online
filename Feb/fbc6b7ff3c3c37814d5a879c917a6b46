On Thursday, Mbeki told the SABC that his presence in the province seeks to “relax” things in the ANC. ANC Women’s League Deputy President Sisi Ntombela expressed confidence that things will soon change for the better in the ANC in the Free State. Currently, the ANC has an Interim Leadership Structure in the Free State, led by Mxolisi Dukwana, since the leadership of the province was disbanded after it was learnt that it was illegally constituted. The structure invited Mbeki to assist the ailing party. Day two of this consultation takes place in Bloemfontein Day two of the consultations is a closed session where ANC Free State structures are deliberating in an honest and open manner the challenges facing the party at a provincial level. It is where Mbeki will pay careful attention and hopefully provide a way forward for the ANC in the Free State. More engagements on the issue of unity and renewal will continue through to Saturday.
