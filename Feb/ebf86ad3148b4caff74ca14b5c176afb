The state intends to oppose the bail application of a 27-year-old alleged intruder of an SABC building in Bloemfontein. Jafta Mofokeng is accused of breaking into the SABC building last month. He made a brief first court appearance on Tuesday last week. His first two appearances were in absentia while he was recuperating in hospital under police guard. This after Mofokeng sustained a gunshot wound during an altercation with a security officer at the SABC offices on the day of the incident. The security officer confronted him after he was spotted via CCTV cameras walking around the building in the early hours of the morning. When a security officer confronted Mofokeng he reportedly attempted to attack him and he was shot. He also allegedly sprayed graffiti on the walls. Police recovered a letter and a USB stick from his backpack. Last week, Free State Hawks Spokesperson Christopher Singo said they had obtained new information about Mofokeng which would allow the state to oppose bail.  “So, when he appears next week on Tuesday, we are going to oppose bail due to the seriousness of the case (and) the issues surrounding his residential address. But the information that we got is that he came from Qwaqwa. We did verify and got the information his address in Qwaqwa. He is a well-known person in Qwaqwa. People do know him but here in Bloemfontein, he is a homeless person. He  does not have a place to stay. So, we are then going to oppose bail due to the seriousness of the case. You’ll would remember SABC, this is a National Key Point.” Case of SABC break-in suspect, Mokheseng Jafta Mofokeng, postponed to the 15th February 2022:
