The Gauteng Health MEC Dr Nomathemba Mokgethi says the Tembisa Hospital, in Ekurhuleni east of Johannesburg, has now been re-opened following the fatal shooting of a nurse by her partner on Wednesday morning. A police officer in uniform shot and killed his nursing assistant partner at the hospital. The police officer, who was on duty arrived at the hospital, called her partner then shot her before turning the gun on himself. Gauteng Department of Health says the Tembisa Hospital has been temporarily closed:  The victim died on the scene and the police officer was airlifted to the Milpark Hospital where he is in a critical condition. Speaking outside the nurse’s home in Ebony Park, Mokgethi says all those affected will be provided with psycho-social assistance. “The staff members that were working with Lebo must get counselling immediately. And the patients that were around must receive counselling immediately and the rest of the staff must also receive counselling. So, the communication went out to calm our patients and to reassure them that the hospital is safe and they can be reassured nothing will happen to them.”
