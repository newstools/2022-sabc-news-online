Eskom CEO Andre De Ruyter says the renewed implementation of rolling blackouts was caused by a shortage of generation capacity following breakdowns of another two generating units overnight. De Ruyter says there is currently a power shortage of nearly 14 000 megawatts due to unplanned maintenance. According to an Eskom statement, Stage 2 loadshedding was implemented this morning at 11h00 and will continue until 05h00 on Monday. De Ruyter says with the emergency generating reserves depleted and refuelling needed at Koeberg power station, and challenges with units at Thuthuka, Kendal, Kusile and Duvha power station, load shedding [“rolling blackouts] was unavoidable. “We do see that the load shedding that we will implement at 11:00 o’clock today will last till 5 o’clock on Monday. It may be that the system will improve and the breakdowns will not be where we are currently, then there’s a possibility that we may lift it. However, it will depend on successful return to service of the unit, as well as whatever breakdown, ”  says De Ruyter. “But very importantly is to make sure that on Monday morning when we start at 5 o’clock,  the diesel tank levels have recovered to a way that we are satisfied.”
