India has given regulatory approval to Russia’s one-shot Sputnik Light COVID-19 vaccine after it authorized Russia’s main vaccine – the two-dose Sputnik V – last year, the Russian Direct Investment Fund said on Sunday. Sputnik Light, the first component of the Sputnik V vaccine, can be used as a booster shot with other vaccines, RDIF said. Head of the fund Kirill Dmitriev called Sputnik Light in a statement “the solution to increase efficacy and duration of other vaccines, including against Omicron variant”.
