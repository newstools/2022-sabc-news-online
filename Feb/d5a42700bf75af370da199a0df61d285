Police Brigadier Francis Dantgan has testified in the Estcourt Magistrates Court that the former Umkhontho we Sizwe Military Veterans Association Spokesperson, Carl Niehaus, spoke to more than 50 people outside the town’s prison when he was arrested in July of last year. People gathered at the prison after former President Jacob Zuma was incarcerated there to serve a 15-month contempt of court sentence. Niehaus is charged with contravening COVID-19 lockdown regulations, which at the time, placed a limit of 50 people attending a gathering. Dantgan has testified that people who gathered at the local courthouse earlier that day dispersed when the police asked them to.
