Roads leading to the High Court in Bloemfontein have been closed with barricades ahead of suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule’s corruption, fraud and money laundering case. There’s a high police presence to monitor the movements of all those going inside the courts. A high number of African National Congress (ANC) supporters are expected to show up in support of Magashule. The former Free State premier, ten other accused and five companies face more than 70 charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering. The charges relate to the alleged irregular awarding of a R255 million asbestos roof removal contract in October 2014. Magashule, businessman Edwin Sodi and former Human Settlements head Thabani Zulu are challenging the legality of the charges against them. Suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule accused of delaying tactics in asbestos case:  A group led by Carl Niehaus has been mobilizing support for Magashule. They say the next two days set for the pre-trial are just a waste of time and the state resources. On Wednesday last week, Magashule attended a thanksgiving service where church members could be seen embracing and welcoming him. It’s yet to be seen if his supporters will be at the court on Monday and Tuesday. On a number of occasions, Magashule insisted the National Prosecution Authority has no case against him. He has vowed to fight to the bitter end to have his name cleared. Magashule and his co-accused contend that the state’s case is premised on the evidence presented before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture.
