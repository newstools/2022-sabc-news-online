The Judge President of the Gauteng Division of the High Court, Dunstan Mlambo, says visible leadership can instil confidence in people. He is the third candidate being interviewed for the position of South Africa’s Chief Justice by the Judicial Service Commission. Mlambo says, “It is my experience as a leader in the judiciary that visible leadership instils confidence in those that are led. I told the judges that I would be visible, and my door would always be open for them should they need any assistance from me. I found that visible and present leadership goes a long way in instilling confidence in members of the bench.” Live proceedings of Judge President Dunstan Mlambo’s JSC interview:  Mlambo’s credentials Mlambo has been Judge President of the Gauteng Division of the High Court since November 2012.
