Over one 100 pupils from Ikamva Lesizwe School in Kenton-On-Sea, in the Eastern Cape, have been rushed to hospital for symptoms allegedly relating to food poisoning. Coincidently, the Department of Education was nearby doing food inspections at various schools and attended to the situation immediately. Provincial Education Spokesperson, Malibongwe Mtima says they are investigating the incident. “As the Department, we are aware of the incident and we are lucky because it happened while our officials were in the area doing some work. As we speak, they are with the learners and teams have been called from Health to check the food while learners have been admitted to hospital. About 117 of them. We are still to know what really happened from the medical reports that we will be getting from the hospital,” says Mtima.
