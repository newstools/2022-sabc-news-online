The defence lawyer of the man who stands accused of the murder of 13-year-old Jerobijin van Wyk, in Klawer on the Cape West Coast, says although her client admitted his guilt to her, he still won’t be considered guilty until he confesses to the crime and pleads guilty in court. Lawyer, Santie Human, was speaking after her client, 56-year-old Daniel Smit, made his first appearance at the Klawer Magistrate’s Court in connection with the boy’s murder. He was arrested last week following the boy’s disappearance. Police discovered human remains at the suspect’s house. He is charged with murder, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and defeating the ends of justice. The case has been postponed to the 26th of April for further investigation.
