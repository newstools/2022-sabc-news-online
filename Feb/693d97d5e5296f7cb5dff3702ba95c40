Police have used rubber bullets to disperse some parents and learners at Hoerskool Jan Viljoen in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg, who have accused government of not listening to their complaints. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is currently at the school following an alleged racially-motivated incident last Friday. It is alleged that a violent altercation between black and white learners broke out at the school. Lesufi is expected to meet with the leadership of the school as well as learners to determine the cause of the incident. “We are here as parents to hear what has been going on; what procedures have been using? There is nothing that has been done for the past years. It’s not only this school. There are so many other schools where children are not allowed to have phones. Kids are complaining everyday. We are sick and tired. Racism, racism,” explains one of the parents.
