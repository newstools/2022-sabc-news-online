The two Thulamela municipal officials who were arrested for alleged corruption and maladministration related to the investment made by the municipality in the now-defunct VBS Mutual Bank have been granted R30 000 bail each. The former Municipal Mayor and current member of Municipal Council at Vhembe District Municipality, Avhashoni Tshifhango, and Thulamela Municipal Manager Hlengani Maluleleke were arrested by the Hawks on Monday.
