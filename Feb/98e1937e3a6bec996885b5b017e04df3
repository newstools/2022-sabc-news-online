The  National Prosecution Authority (NPA) has welcomed the conviction of the Walter Sisulu University student, Sibongile Mani, on the theft charges at the East London Regional Court. Mani was erroneously paid R14 million in NSFAS cash by Intellimali. She spent more than R800 000 over a three month period before the error was spotted. The payment she was due to receive was only R1 400. Pre-sentencing proceedings are to be heard on 18 March. NPA spokesperson, Anelisa Ngcakani, says Mani’s bail has been extended. “We welcome the judgement. We were able to prove that our case is truthful and reliable. Unfortunately, the accused didn’t take the court into confidence to testify which actually worked against her. But we believe we presented a strong case. The investigation was thorough and the prosecutor presented a strong case in court,” says Ngcakani.
