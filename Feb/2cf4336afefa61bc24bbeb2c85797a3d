The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO) has recognised Nuclear scientist, Nomso Kana, for her contributions in empowering women and girls in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, through her work. This was during the Ubuntu Awards, currently underway at the ICC in Cape Town. Kana took home the statue for social responsibility. She is also a South African delegation leader for the world sustainability energy forum based in Austria. She dedicated the award to the girls she’s met through her work. “Girls that I meet in the SADC region, with so much interest in science, really want to contribute to the growth of our continent; and this is where we believe our generation will lead in artificial intelligence. Africa, and our country, will not just consume, we’ll also participate, innovate, and also generate ideas that can put our continent in the forefront.” https://t.co/etCEuzylBM — DIRCO South Africa (@DIRCO_ZA) February 12, 2022  Video: The 6th Ubuntu Awards Ceremony
