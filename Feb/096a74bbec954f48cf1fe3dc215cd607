The South African Medical Association (SAMA) says that the chairperson of its Board of Directors Dr Angelique Coetzee has stepped down. Dr Coetzee made the announcement on Thursday night, however, will remain an ordinary board member. The current Vice-Chairperson of the Board Dr Mvuyisi Mzukwa will assume the role of interim Chairperson of the Board while a search gets under way for Coetzee’s replacement. Dr Edward Ngwenya, Chairperson of SAMA’s Chairperson’s Forum will be the Board’s interim Vice-Chairperson. Dr Coetzee’s stepping down follows SAMA’s apology for her remarks that the admission processes to medical schools were highly politicised, that race played a significant role in determining acceptance to medical faculties and in many instances more than the applicant’s matric performance. She later apologised unreservedly for any emotional hurt her statement may have caused. After considerable deliberation, the SAMA Board accepted her apology. SAMA’s Board in a statement acknowledged the fact that the stringent entry requirements are meant to ensure the provision of only the highest quality medical professionals for the country. SAMA further acknowledged that entrance to medical schools requires a high level of academic achievement across the board and that all candidates selected for entry into medical school are chosen inter aliaon merit and ability.
