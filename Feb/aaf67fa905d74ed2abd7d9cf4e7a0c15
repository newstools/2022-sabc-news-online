The Govan Mbeki Municipality in Secunda Mpumalanga says the judgment by the High Court in Pretoria has not ordered the municipality to retain the former Municipal Manager Felani Mndebele to his position. Govan Mbeki Executive Mayor Nhlakanipho Zuma says the council has resolved to terminate Mndebele’s contract. The court ordered the municipality to comply with its legislation. Mndebele was suspended for failing to submit financial statements to the Auditor General and the unlawful appointment of an electricity debt collector. Residents protest over electricity crisis in Mpumalanga: The municipality is being accused of not following policies when Mndebele was subjected to a disciplinary process. “Council decided not take the route going back to 2014 and implementing the legislation in line with 2014 and decided to take a route of mutual engagement and termination of the contract of the municipal manager. The discussion led by the executive mayor mandated by the council which those particular engagements did not yield any positive results and the matter reported back to council and council took a decision to terminate the contract of the municipal manager.”
