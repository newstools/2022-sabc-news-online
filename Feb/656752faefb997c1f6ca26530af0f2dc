Chief Justice nominee Mandisa Maya says the constitutional court can take tips from the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in dealing with  delays in delivering judgements. Maya says the SCA has developed a system to  overcome such challenges. She was the second candidate to be interviewed by the Judicial Service Commission for the post of the country’s top judge. “It seems to me what is needed  in the court is good organisation and time management, just working smartly. And firmly instilling that SCA culture that you do not even leave Bloemfontein at the end of the court term until you have at least prepared a decent draft judgement in all matters during that term, so that those matters can be finalised during the next term.” JSC Interview | Justice Mandisa Maya – PT2:  Maya attributed her rise into the Judiciary to the likes of former colleague Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza who recognised her potential. She says her hard work and honesty and integrity also led to her achievements. She is the President of the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA). Maya was asked by her Deputy at the SCA Xola Petse who is presiding over the Judicial Service Committee proceedings how her potential was identified. She says, “The person who got me started  in this path is Advocate Dumisa Ntsebeza who at the time had moved from Transkei to Cape Town, but he would still come and do cases in the Transkei Division.” “So, I met him in motion court and I think he saw how I performed there and he kept saying we are looking for women Acting Judges in that division, please, please let me submit your name to the powers that be – that were JP Edwin King and his Deputy, JP Hlophe,” she adds.
