Chief Justice nominee Raymond Zondo says there is only one white acting judge in the Constitutional Court. He has confirmed that the court has not had a permanent white judge on the bench for some time. Zondo says the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) will meet in April to consider the appointment of two judges to fill the vacancies. He says it will be an opportunity for the JSC to consider the matter and make a decision. Zondo was responding to a question from Supreme Court of Appeal Deputy President Xola Petse who is chairing proceedings at the interviews for the country’s next Chief Justice in Sandton, Johannesburg. Petse wanted Zondo to comment on the issue based on a constitutional requirement that racial and gender composition should be reflected when considering the appointment of judicial officers. In his response, Zondo said: “There is one acting judge in the Constitutional Court. So when this body considers or interviews the candidates for ConCourt in April, this body will have an opportunity to decide whether it places before the President for his decision some white candidates to enable him to appoint one of both or fill one of both vacancies with some white judges.” Zondo is the fourth and last judge to be interviewed for the position of Chief Justice. He also reflected on one of his Labour Court judgments that gave workers the right to be heard when they embarked on an unprotected strike. “After I handed that judgment, there was quick some noise in the media from employers, but that judgment has still stood the test of time as far as I remember. I may be mistaken but I think the Supreme Court of Appeal subsequently approved it. That’s my recollection. But as I understand it, that remains the law that workers are entitled to be heard even if the employer may think that their strike is illegal,” said Zondo.
