African National Congress (ANC) NEC Member Dakota Legoete says the future looks bright for suspended ANC Secretary General Ace Magashule. He says the state has a weak case against Magashule, who appeared in the Bloemfontein High Court today, on charges of fraud, corruption and money laundering relating to the failed Asbestos roof project in the Free State. Legoete supported Magashule, alongside Carl Niehaus and a few other staunch supporters of the former Free State premier. “The future looks very bright for the secretary-general, the state case is getting weaker and weaker, there’s no case here, but so far so good don’t panic. It’s clear that even the arrest was unlawful. It’s clear that the SG during the tenure he was not an accounting officer, so he can’t be dragged into some things of the supply chain,” says Legoete.
