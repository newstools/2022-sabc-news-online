Health Minister, Joe Phaahla and his deputy, Sibongiseni Dhlomo have visited the KwaMagxaki High School at Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape where the Pfizer vaccine against coronavirus has been administered to eligible learners. The duo are visiting a number of areas to check on the vaccine rollout in the Eastern Cape. More than 1.8 million people are fully vaccinated in the Eastern Cape. More than 3,2 million people have received a first dose of vaccine. Minister Phaahla says the vaccination of young people is imperative for effective learning in schools. “So, we are very promising because with more young people are coming forward we are now going back to having all learners in class all at once. Without having to worry about the spread of Covid-19. We really hope that everyone could come forward so that things can go back to normal for learners and teachers.” Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga earlier this year said the department was working closely with parents and schools to intensify its efforts to vaccinate learners from the start of the 2022 academic year. Angie Motshekga monitors the basic education sector vaccination programme:  This is in an attempt to curb the spread of COVID-19 as learners return to school. During a media briefing on the readiness of schools ahead of the start of this academic year, Motshekga says learners will not be forced to vaccinate if they don’t want to.
