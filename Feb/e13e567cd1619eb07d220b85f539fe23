The Carnival City Casino hotel on Gauteng’s East rand has been evacuated following fire that broke out earlier on Saturday. At this stage it’s still unclear how the fire started. Ekurhuleni Emergency Services are currently on scene to conduct a full investigation. “There were lots of people who were inside the hotel. So, we were busy with evacuation, but the information we are receiving is that the fire has been extinguished and that can be confirmed because all the vehicles are moving out of Carnival City and we are still going to do an on-site investigation and more information will be given later,” explains EMS Spokesperson, William Ntladi. CARNIVAL CITY FIRE was quickly extinguished by the City’s Brakpan & Benoni central fire stations, backed by Tsakane fire station, who responded to the call just before 19h00 tonight. No casualties recorded.#CoEWorks pic.twitter.com/Ry5Ik876g9 — CITY OF EKURHULENI (@City_Ekurhuleni) February 5, 2022
