Shoba says he only contacted Malepane for cigarettes as they were banned during the hard lockdown. “I wouldn’t even call it a relationship, he was an acquaintance. I got his number from my friend Sbusiso, Swagger because I wanted cigarettes. I met with Muzi on the 4th of June 2020 to buy cigarettes . I arrived in my vehicle, I parked at his house and he came out. He gave me a carton,” says Shoba. VIDEO: Alleged mastermind behind murder of Tshegofatso Pule back in court Tuesday 15 February 2022
