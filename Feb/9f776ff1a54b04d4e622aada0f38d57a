The former Mandeni Police Station commander Mary-Jane Ziningi Zulu has committed suicide. Independent Police Investigative Directorate says Zulu drank poison on Friday morning, ending her life. She was facing two counts of theft for allegedly stealing R108 000 in exhibit money that was kept at her office. She had appeared in Richards Bay Commercial Crimes Court in June last year where she was formally charged. She was due to make another court appearance on Friday. IPID Spokesperson Grace Langa says the case has been postponed to the 4th of March. “Former Station Commander of Mandeni Police Station was suppose to appear in court for alleged theft of exhibit money that was saved in her office. She was expected to perhaps plead guilty at the Richards Bay Commercial Crimes Court this morning. Unfortunately, we were informed this morning that the former Station Commander committed suicide. She consumed poison this morning when she was supposed to come to court and so, the case has been postponed to the 4th of March for her lawyers to bring death certificate as a confirmation.”
