African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) leader Kenneth Meshoe has called on all employees who suffered side effects due to COVID-19 vaccines to lodge claims from both the state and their employers. Meshoe made this call during the Joint State of the Nation (SONA) Debate at the City Hall in Cape Town on Tuesday. He criticised President Cyril Ramaphosa for his mixed messages on vaccination, saying he promised that no one will be forced to take the jab. Meshoe says, “The ACDP believes that all employees who suffer adverse effects as a result of the jab at work be compensated by both the state and the company they work for. Former employees such as Zakhele Goqo who was a paramedic in Newcastle and Soreka Oosthuizen are amongst such people and need urgent assistance with their medical expenses.” VIDEO: Debate on SONA 2022: 15 February Universities Earlier this month, the South African Union of Students (SAUS) said it is hopeful that guidelines on a mandatory vaccine policy will bring clarity and relief regarding vaccinations at institutions of higher learning. Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande announced that a team of experts had been put together to provide guidelines on mandatory vaccines at universities. Some universities have already implemented such a policy while others have put it on hold until they get a directive from the department. The SAUS is opposed to students being compelled to vaccinate in order to gain access to universities.
