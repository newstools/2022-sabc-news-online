The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) has resolved that the mayoral candidate selection process must be rerun in the Vhembe District and Makhado local municipalities in Limpopo. Samuel Munyai and Dowelani Nenguda were retained as Mayors in the two municipalities after the Local Government Elections. This was pending the finalisation of investigations into the candidates recommended by the region. The provincial executive committee of the ANC held a special meeting in Polokwane on Wednesday. ANC provincial spokesperson Donald Selamolela says party officials have 14 days to finalise the rerun process. “The REC is given the mandate to restart to process, the process is nil, is nullified, is going to start afresh. It has nothing to do with the individual candidate in those two municipalities, it’s all about the process. Where we are seated as the provincial executive committee will await the situation where they will say these are the recommended names. As the province, we still again look through the names to satisfy ourselves that the names are fitting the criteria prescribed by the national executive committee,” says Selamolela. However, political analyst Levy Ndou says the rerun might result in a dispute if it disadvantages those who were previously recommended. “The process should not be seen as it is putting others at a disadvantaged position in the sense that some were previously recommended. They might feel that the rerun is actually going to disadvantage them and their supporters might also feel that the treatment that they are getting is quite unfair. The ANC has to do this process in an open and transparent manner so that non of those candidates could actually see themselves as the victim of the process,” says Ndou.
