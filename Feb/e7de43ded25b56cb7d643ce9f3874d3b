Rand Water has advised Johannesburg residents that parts of the city will experience reduced water supply this coming Saturday as City Power begins maintenance work on its transformers. The water disruptions will last for nine hours from 6:30 in the morning to 3:30 in the afternoon. The second round of maintenance is due to commence on March 5, 2022, and will last for the same duration. Rand Water says areas that will be expected to be affected include Soweto, Roodepoort, Langlaagte and Southdale. Rand Water’s Executive Manager, Eddie Singo says, “They found some technical deficiencies which need to be corrected before they lose their infrastructure itself. So we want to applaud them for doing that proactive work.” Singo says, “We are at a point where they are saying to avert a bigger problem, let’s take out these transformers and work on them. It is going to be a temporary inconvenience but it is a lesser inconvenience than when infrastructure fails. This is normal maintenance work that you do to check if your infrastructure is healthy.” Water disruptions to affect some Joburg residents this weekend: <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
