Recent data released by i-TRAFFIC this week shows traffic volumes have increased in Cape Town and people have officially headed back to offices. According to i-TRAFFIC, a traveller information service provided by the South African National Roads Agency, traffic entering Cape Town’s central business district on the N2 highway increased for four consecutive months towards the end of last year. Between August and November, there were 285 551 cars entering town, peaking at 434 573 in November. Several data from the CBD indicates that office workers are returning to their desks. This due to higher vaccination rates and staff wanting to feel like a valued part of an organisation. Since 2020, remote working took the stage in most companies as a result of COVID-19.
