Professor at the Wits Business School Jannie Rossouw says the current government is not doing enough to ensure that there’s a conducive environment for businesses to grow and and create jobs. Rossouw’s statement comes after President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his recent State of the Nation Address (SONA) that it was not the responsibility of government to create jobs. Ramaphosa said government instead created an environment in which business could address unemployment. Professor Rossouw explains what government needs to do to create such an environment. “We should just abolish the Department of Small Business Development because clearly they are not functioning. Secondly, government must be policy set for the private sector to plan and see how they can function in the economy. Then thirdly, government must deliver services. The public sector needs service delivery to be able to flourish.”  Fierce Criticism Ramaphosa’s SONA address came under fierce criticism from opposition parties as well at the two-day Joint SONA Debate which started on Monday afternoon. His speech was put under the spotlight for his stance on job creation, State-own Entities, the appointment of a Chief Justice and the high unemployment faced by Black women in South Africa. Ramaphosa’s speech was also defended by those in the African National Congress (ANC). The President drew mixed reactions when he told the nation last week that job creation was the responsibility of the private sector. He said government’s role was to provide the conditions for businesses to grow and generate jobs. During the debate, the Democratic Alliance (DA) also announced that it will table a no-confident motion in the entire Cabinet.
