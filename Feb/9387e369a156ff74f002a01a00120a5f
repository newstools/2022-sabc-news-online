The N3 between Ashburton and Lynnfield in KwaZulu-Natal has been re-opened to traffic in both directions. This follows the overturning of a gas tanker on Friday night. This forced a heavy backlog of traffic with light motor vehicles being diverted. “The freeway is now open to traffic, on the N3, both bounds at Ashburton following a major closure that started yesterday, we are monitoring the free flow of traffic at the moment,” says Zinhle Mali, KwaZulu-Natal Road Traffic Inspectorate spokesperson.
