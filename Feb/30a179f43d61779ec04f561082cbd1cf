The African Christian Democratic Party (ACDP) says it hopes Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana will present a pro-growth, debt stabilisation budget on Wednesday that also deals with social pressures. The party says it is crucial to stimulate economic growth and job creation after the devastating COVID-19 lockdowns. Chief Whip Steve Swart says they hope that there will be no tax hikes as the population is already overburdened by fuel and electricity price increases. “We are also opposed to further bailouts for state-owned companies. Those that are not strategically significant must be released, Challenges at Eskom must be speedily resolved. Lastly, the ACDP has repeatedly called for additional funding for the Hawks, SIU and NPA. Criminals must be put behind bars and millions of rands stolen through state capture must be recovered,” says Swart. Meanwhile, the Social Justice Coalition in Cape Town has appealed to the national government and its Western Cape counterpart to prioritise safety in informal settlements, deploy more visible policing and implement the recommendations of the Khayelitsha Commission of Enquiry report. The commission was appointed in August 2012 to probe the inefficiency of police services in the crime-riddled Khayelitsha and neighbouring communities. The advocacy group has called on Godongwana to consider these factors in his budget speech, set to be delivered on Wednesday in order to curb crime in informal settlements. The crime rate in the Western Cape informal settlements is a cause of concern. One of the newly formed informal settlements, Sanitizer in Langa, is already plagued by violence. Last week, a perpetrator allegedly raped and killed a 26-year-old woman in a shack, before he disposed of her body in a nearby canal.
