ActionSA has expressed concern over what it calls “short-sightedness” by some political parties who are in coalition with them and the Democratic Alliance (DA) at the Ekurhuleni Metro Municipality in Gauteng. The party’s National Chairperson Michael Beaumont says as things stand in council, there is an imminent collapse of the municipality as there are talks for a vote of no confidence in the coalition arrangement. The party says, however, it’s up for what is right, which is service delivery to the citizens of Ekurhuleni. Beaumont says they are still interested in being a part of the coalition in Ekurhuleni. “We are here to say there is a concern regarding the impact this will have. Because if it is that Ekurhuleni is going to fall into a motion of no confidence in a month or two and we know it’s imminent, we received intelligence that it’s already brewing. So, if this government were to fall into this motion was to succeed, the likely impact would be the collapse of that government and a huge dent into the broader project which is to build confidence in 2024 on coalitions.” Beaumont explains more in the tweeted video below: “We are here because we believe there is a short-sightedness in this decision-making. The likely impact in Ekurhuleni will be the collapse of that coalition government, and a huge dent in confidence for 2024 and coalition governments.” pic.twitter.com/6swxHZRumi — ActionSA (@Action4SA) February 7, 2022
