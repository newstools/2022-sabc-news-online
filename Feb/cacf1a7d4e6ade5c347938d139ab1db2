Police Minister Bheki Cele says most of the weapons discovered after Monday’s shootout between police and gunmen in Rosettenville in the south of Johannesburg are used in the Police and Defence Force. Eight members of the gang of alleged cash-in-transit robbers were killed and another eight were arrested. The police have been monitoring the gang since last week. The shootout ensued after the alleged robbers shot at a police helicopter and wounded the pilot’s assistant. Four police officers were injured and are being treated in hospital. A manhunt for nine more suspects who fled the scene has been launched. Cele says they are investigating the origins of the weapons. “Most riffles here are Ak47’s with double magazines. AK47 takes 30 at a go which means each one is having 60. There are explosives here, there’s petrol, umuthi wenyanga [traditional medicine] and everything. There is one R4.” “It [R4] would be used by the Defence Force mostly. So those would be taken for ballistics, including the AK47s, even if they are not coming from our own [country], to see if they do not come from the state. But the investigation is going on,” adds Cele. Police Minister visits scene after six suspects were killed in Rosettenville:   Gauteng Police Commissioner Lieutenant-General Elias Mawela says, “It is confirmed that these guys are hardcore criminals. The number of unlicensed and illegal riffles which are still lying there, we have counted eight and there is another one on the freeway where it was thrown by those escaping when they realised they were being chased by the police. All the vehicles which we have recovered inside that house are positively hijacked vehicles, high-powered vehicles. So we are dealing with hardcore criminals here.” Below is the full interview with Cele:  Meanwhile, over a week ago, 13 suspects were arrested in connection with a cash-in-transit heist in Westonaria, west of Johannesburg.
