The Automobile Association (AA) has appealed to Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana to consider not increasing the General Fuel and Road Accident levies. AA says if an increase is implemented it will have a negative impact on poor communities. It comes as Godongwana prepares to deliver his inaugural National Budget Speech on Wednesday next week. The AA’s Spokesperson Layton Beard says, “We are asking, as we have asked for many years, that those levies do not increase – even by inflation of 5 – 6%. Those increases hurt the poorest of the poor and do have an impact on the fuel price generally.” “We would like to see a moratorium on those increases, at least for the moment, especially as we are in a situation where we are touching on record-high fuel prices again,” says Beard. Our country faces huge economic challenges & the high #FuelPrice adds to it. We urge the Minister of Finance not to raise fuel levies & to review the current fuel price structure during his Budget Speech on Feb 23. #ReviewTheFuel #JoinTheMovement #Petition https://t.co/Tj3xobSwnI — AA South Africa (@AASouthAfrica) February 16, 2022
