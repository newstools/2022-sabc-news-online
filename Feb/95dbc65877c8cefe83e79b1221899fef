Murder accused Ntuthuko Shoba says he didn’t know it was Muzi Malepane that picked up Tshegofatso Pule the night she died. Shoba has taken the stand in the High Court in Johannesburg in Pule’s murder trial. Pule was murdered in June 2020 when she was eight months pregnant, after leaving Shoba’s residence in Florida west of Johannesburg. Convicted murderer Malepane picked her up for what he said was on Shoba’s instructions. Shoba says he called an Uber for Pule for her to get to his place that fateful night. He says Pule was on her phone most of the night, probably texting or on social media. Later that evening, Shoba said Pule informed him that her ride was outside. He says she was surprised because he was the one that usually called the Uber for her, or took her home. Shoba says he walked her towards the gate and waited about eight meters away. The window went down, he says, as she interacted with the Jeep driver and sat in the front passenger seat. He says based on the interaction, he assumed they knew each other. However, despite being in the presence of Muzi earlier that day, he didn’t recognise him that night as he was wearing a cap and a mask in the dark.

Shoba has denied that he gave convicted murderer Malepane any orders to kill Pule. Shoba says he only contacted Malepane for cigarettes as they were banned during the hard lockdown. “I wouldn’t even call it a relationship. He was an acquaintance. I got his number from my friend Sbusiso, Swagger because I wanted cigarettes. I met with Muzi on the 4th of June 2020 to buy cigarettes . I arrived in my vehicle, I parked at his house and he came out. He gave me a carton,” says Shoba. VIDEO: Tshegofatso Pule murder trial: 29 January 2022:
