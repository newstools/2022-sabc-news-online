Parliament arson and terrorism accused Zandile Mafe says he will take his legal fight to the highest court in the land. Mafe, who denies setting parliament alight last month, was yesterday denied bail in the Cape Town Regional Court. The court found that he did not prove exceptional circumstances for his release. Mafe insists that he is being made a scapegoat and intends to sue the state. He is due to appear in the magistrate’s court next Friday. Defence attorney, Luvuyo Godla says they will apply for leave to appeal on an urgent basis. “It can be remanded for a month or two months. It will depend on the state, how long it needs, but it won’t interfere with the process of appealing the matter, and its where Mr Mafe is not even required to attend in person. We will simply transcribe the record, and thereafter we get a date in the high court and the matter will be heard,” Luvuyo Godla explains. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Western Cape says after successfully opposing bail, its next step is to ensure that it proves its cases against Mafe, beyond reasonable doubt. “They are even going to go to the highest court in the land. They will find us there. We will be the first there. We will oppose that appeal. We don’t believe any other court can come to a different conclusion than this one. So, we will oppose it,” says NPA Spokesperson, Eric Ntabazalila. VIDEO: Suspected Parliament arsonist Zandile Mafe denied bail
