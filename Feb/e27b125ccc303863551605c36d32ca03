The family of the slain school principal who was shot and killed along with his wife at Saint Faith near Height flats in Port Shepstone on the south coast of KwaZulu-Natal are seeking answers. Gugulethu Earnest Sijadu and his wife were killed in an execution style while sleeping at their home on Friday night. They were found in a pool of blood by their children. It is believed that their killers gained access into the house through an open window. According to the family, only two cellphones belonging to the principal were stolen allegedly by the suspects. Daughters of the deceased, Nomonde and Khumbuzile Sijadu say all what they want is justice. “I remember the other day me and my siblings, my father called us in the dining room and he told us that ‘my children one day I will die. I will not keep running like this because some people in the community believe ngithwele. I don’t know what it is that I have done wrong to the people that they will hate me so much.’ We even cried to the point thinking that he was going to die at that time. I will not keep running like this one day they will get me,” says Nomonde.
