Gauteng officials say the cause of the fire that gutted large parts of the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Johannesburg last year is still unknown. Gauteng Department of Health spokesperson, Thabo Masebe says about 30%of the hospital’s infrastructure that was destroyed has still not been fixed. This includes the casualty, psychiatric, and cardiothoracic ICU wards of the hospital. The department says renovations are expected to be finalised by April next year. “The cause of fire is still unknown they are still waiting for the report from the police to see if such people must be held accountable, the budget is still to be determined,” says Thabo Masebe.
