The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has suspended all branch general meetings (BGMs) in two metropolitan regions, W.B Rubusana in East London and Nelson Mandela Bay due to the violence linked to some recent BGMs. An ANC councillor in the Nelson Mandela Bay metro, Mzwandile Booi was shot dead last weekend. A day before that there was an attempt on the life of another branch leader in Kwanobuhle. A BGM in East London also turned violent with gunshots fired during the proceedings. ANC Eastern Cape spokesperson, Loyiso Magqashela  says the national and provincial leadership will be visiting these areas to engage  the branches. “We have to visit  Gqeberha,  sit  with all the zones and branches same as the area of WB Rubisana. We said we must get a report that will deal with those matters that are there.  We have issued a letter to postpone BGM that are in these regions  so that we iron out all these differences  and the threats  to organisational processes.” Video: ANC councillor Mzwandile Booi gunned down in Nelson Mandela Bay [ 14 February 2021]  The ANC in the Nelson Mandela Bay region, in the Eastern Cape, says the party is struggling to make sense of the murder of Councillor Mzwandile Booi. The Nelson Mandela Bay Ward 20 councillor was shot dead in his car in Gqeberha while driving home on Sunday night. Chairperson of the region, Babalwa Lobishe, says they are appealing to the community to come forward with information to help solve the murder. “So, it can’t be that the same people that have just been voted in are at risk among the same people that have put them in those positions. So, we are appealing to our communities to protect our councillors and support them throughout their tenure,” adds Lobishe.
