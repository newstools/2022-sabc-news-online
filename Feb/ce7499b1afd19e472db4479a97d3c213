The prosecution in the case of suspended African National Congress (ANC) Secretary-General, Ace Magashule, has accused him of using delaying tactics to avoid pleading to numerous criminal charges. This is contained in the answering papers submitted in the High Court in Bloemfontein. The former Free State premier, 10 others accused, and five companies face more than 70 charges of corruption, fraud and money laundering. The charges relate to the alleged irregular awarding of a R255-million asbestos roof removal contract in October 2014. Magashule, businessman, Edwin Sodi, former Human Settlements head, Thabani Zulu, are challenging the legality of the charges against them. Magashule is also seeking seven declaratory orders, which include the State to disclose a list of witnesses who have implicated him in the alleged crimes. Legal expert, Sekonyela Moeketsi explains: “Where someone requires the list which in the higher court is mainly provided and attached to the indictment, I’m not sure why it has not been the case in this instance, it helps for many reasons. It helps for preparation; you know who are the witnesses against you therefore you are able to prepare against those witnesses. But also you know who are the state witnesses which means you then know who not to approach.” Asbestos case involving Ace Magashule to be heard in February:
