The South African Post Office has launched a service for drivers to renew their motor vehicle licence disc online. The renewal process including payment can be done online. The disc can then be collected from a Post Office or delivered to your door. Spokesperson for the South African Post Office, Johan Kruger, says the online service is a convenient and safe way for motorists to renew their vehicle licences. “We can deliver the licence to your door at R75 or you can choose to collect the licence from your nearest post office and then there’s no extra charge at all. Once you clicked on the website, it guides you step by step through the process to register, and once you have registered, you’re there forever. It means that you can then pay your car licence every year. You going to have to download the Masterpass App because that is what you use to pay. In urban areas we believe we can do it in 3 -5 days, it will be a little longer in outlying areas,” says Kruger. Clarity on e-tolls & licence discs In March last year, the South African National Roads Agency (Sanral) announced it was planning to implement a new legal framework to ensure motorists pay their e-toll bills. This would mean motorists travelling on Gauteng freeways who fail to pay may receive hefty fines or face the possibility of their vehicle license disk renewals being blocked. In a build-up to the Local Government Elections in November, the Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng urged government to provide clarity on e-tolls. The party had said it will turn off toll gantries across provinces if it won in the elections. Meanwhile, the Department of Transport last month said it is clearing the current backlog of printing drivers’ licence cards. More details in the video below:
