The 59 year old Constitutional Court justice who turns 60 on the 27 March has a lengthy legal career.

Within three years of this appointment as the youngest judge in the county, Madlanga was appointed an Acting Judge at the Supreme Court of Appeal in Bloemfontein. He was later appointed permanently as a Judge of Appeal in the Competition Appeal Court. He continued acting on the SCA bench as the Competition Appeal Court was new and still had to function fully. His acting position at the Supreme Court of Appeal lasted only for a year. This as he had to fill another position of Acting Judge President of the Mthatha High Court. While in the Acting Judge President position, Madlanga was appointed an Acting Justice of the Constitutional Court. But personal circumstances forced him to resign from the judiciary and return to the Bar as senior counsel. He practised in Mthatha and Johannesburg. The former JSC commissioner, was later appointed permanently as a Constitutional Court Justice in August 2013.
