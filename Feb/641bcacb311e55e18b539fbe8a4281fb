Lessons have been disrupted at the Lotus Gardens Secondary School in Pretoria due to the lack of maintenance at the school. Parents and learners have also accused the school’s management of embezzling funds meant for maintenance. Learners are standing outside the school with parents holding placards reading corruption must stop and fix our school. Many of the school’s classrooms are in a derelict state, ceilings of some of the classrooms having collapsed, doors broken and windows shattered. Learners say there has not been any teaching taking place since schools reopened for the new academic year and they are worried that they will not be able to catch up on lost tuition time. Parents are also worried and question what happened to funds allocated to schools for maintenance and the more than R1000 in school fees they pay each year.
