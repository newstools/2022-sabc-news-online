The High Court in Johannesburg has reserved judgment in the matter between Western Cape Judge President John Hlophe and the Judicial Service Commmission (JSC). Hlophe is challenging the JSC’s recommendation that he be impeached in Parliament. The Judicial Conduct Tribunal has found Hlophe guilty of gross judicial misconduct. This relates to a 2008 complaint by all the justices of the Constitutional Court that he had sought to improperly influence the outcome of the corruption case against former President Jacob Zuma. Earlier in a virtual hearing chaired by Deputy Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba, his lawyer Thabani Masuku questioned the constitutionality of the composition of the meeting of the JSC which deliberated on the Hlophe matter.
