The National Department of Basic Education has launched what it terms “the National Policy on the Prevention and Management of learner pregnancy in schools” in Platinum Village near Rustenburg in the North West. The Department says this is aimed at reducing the rising number of learner pregnancies in schools. Deputy Minister of Basic Education, Reginah Mhaule says it is disturbing that the country has recorded 132 000 deliveries amongst girls aged between ten and nineteen for the 2020/2021 financial year.  Mhaule says the policy will help educate learners about prevention methods. “Through this policy, we reiterate that to prevent the early and unintended pregnancies, the department will continue to strengthen the provision of comprehensive education, through the curriculum. The comprehensive sexuality education provides the learner with information knowledge and skills to make informed choices with regard to their reproductive health and reduce risks thus choose a healthy lifestyle,” says Reginah Mhaule.
