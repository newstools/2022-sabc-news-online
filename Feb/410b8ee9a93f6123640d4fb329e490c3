Chaos has erupted during the Gauteng Judge President Dunstan Mlambo‘s interview for the Chief Justice position. EFF leader and Commissioner Julius Malema has rounded on a journalist during proceedings as discussions became heated over the fairness of Mlambo being quizzed about sexual harassment rumors without prior warning. “I am not talking to you man. I am not talking to you. We are not going to be harassed here by a journalist. There is a journalist here. I don’t know if she took her medication or what. Every time we speak here, she speaks here at the back. She must not do that. She comes here with some white tendency. And she thinks she is superior to all of us. I am not going to take that from her. I will make sure that that incident is dealt with appropriately.” JSC Interview | Judge President Dunstan Mlambo – Part 2:  Mlambo has denied allegations of sexual harassment and described the  rumours as poisonous. He faced the questions during his interview by the Judicial Service Commission for the position of Chief Justice. JSC Commissioner Dali Mpofu asked him to clarify the allegations and reminded him that it was an impeachable offence it they were true. “There is no substance to the rumour. It’s a rumour. And I think its a poisonous rumour. There is actually no substance to it. I was actually shocked when I heard about it and I was actually hoping that someone would come up and say I’m one of those who sexually harassed by Judge President. So, it’s unfortunate that people are using people’s names willy-nilly in spreading rumours of this nature. There is completely no substance to that rumour.”
