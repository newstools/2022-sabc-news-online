Three people, including two students of the University of the Free State, have been arrested and charged with public violence following demonstrations outside the gate of the main campus in Bloemfontein. Students protested against the implementation of the mandatory vaccination policy. The new policy requires that students and staff produce a vaccination certificate to gain entrance to the campus, while those who are not vaccinated should apply for an exemption and undergo a weekly COVID-19 test with negative results in order to gain access. On Wednesday student formations at the University reiterated their stance against the mandatory vaccination policy. They said they are not opposing vaccination but students must not be coerced into taking the COVID-19 vaccine. According to the students their constitutional right to access education should not be trampled on. Some students are calling for a review of the policy, while others want it to be completely scrapped. The implementation of the policy is believed to have also played a major role in creating a bottleneck for registrations, which closed on Friday.
