Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi is expected to meet with parents at Hoërskool Jan Viljoen in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg, amidst allegations of sexual misconduct, racism claims. Lesufi is set to meet with the parents on Thursday evening, following a violent altercation between black and white learners that broke out at the school last week, resulting in classes being suspended. On Monday, rubber bullets were fired after angry parents charged at police cars and the school gates accusing the department of not dealing with their complaints. Addressing parents outside the school gate on Monday, Lesufi pleaded with them not to teach their children violence. He said, “I want to plead with you, let us not teach our children violence. I want to assure you [that] this matter is receiving our immediate attention. There is no one who will hide it, postpone it or disguise it. We are dealing with racism, that’s nothing else but racism.” WARNING: STRONG LANGUAGE Hoërskool Jan Viljoen tensions

SAHRC Commissioner Andre Gaum said: “We have decided to investigate the allegations of unfair discrimination and racism at the school as well as the voice note being circulated on social media where learners are being called the so-called “K” word.” Gaum said the Commission had an interview with the school’s principal to find out what happened and says the investigation is ongoing and more interviews would have to be conducted.
