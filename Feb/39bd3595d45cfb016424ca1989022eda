The Gauteng Health Department says it will start its annual Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programme for girls in Grade five or above nine years old from Monday, until the end of March in all public primary schools. The campaign aims to protect girls from developing cervical cancer later in life. Parents and guardians who have not yet signed the consent form are encouraged to do so. Provincial Health spokesperson, Motalatale Modiba says: “Learners who were reached during this first period will be vaccinated when schools open on the 5th of April 2022. The second dose of the HPV vaccine will be given after six months from the second of September to the 31st of October 2022.” Modiba also assured parents that the consent forms will not be used for COVID-19 vaccination. “The consent form for HPV and the integrated school health programme will not be used for the COVID-19 vaccination programme,” says Modiba.  We wish to remind parents of school girls that are in Grade 5 or 9-yrs-old & above that the HPV campaign’s first round will take place between 14 February to 31 March 2022.
