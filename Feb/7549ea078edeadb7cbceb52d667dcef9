The application of four accused in the asbestos corruption case has been adjourned until Tuesday in the High Court in Bloemfontein. The court heard arguments by former Free State head of Human Settlements Nthimotse Mokhesi, businessman Edwin Sodi, and former Human Settlements director-general, Thabani Zulu that the charges against them be withdrawn. They contend that the state depended on the State Capture Commission’s evidence to prosecute them. They have told the court that incriminating evidence at the State Capture Commission’s hearings is not admissible. The court will hear arguments of suspended ANC secretary general, Ace Magashule tomorrow. NPA spokesperson, Mthunzi Mhaga maintains that the state has a strong case against the accused. “We are hoping that the civil proceedings will be cleared tomorrow so that we get a judgment before the 10th of June so that it doesn’t affect the pre-trial conference. So that later on there will be a setting of the trial date where all the issues that they are bringing up now can be properly ventilated, despite their long arguments, we still confident that charges against the accused are sustained. We still confident that the witnesses that we have lined up will be able to present credible evidence in the long run when the trial starts,” says Mhaga.
