Motorists have been urged to drive with caution around the Snake Park area in Soweto this morning, due to protest action. It’s understood that residents have blocked Impala Road with rocks and burning tyres. It’s not yet clear what the protest is about. Johannesburg Metro Police Department’s Wayne Minaar says police are maintaining a presence in the area. “There are protests at the moment at the main entrance to Snake Park affecting traffic on Impala Road. Motorists should exercise caution at Impala Road and the main entrance of Snake Park. More officers have been sent to assist with traffic.” Meanwhile, protesting students at the Nelson Mandela University in Gqeberha are blockading entrances to its north and south campuses. The protest seems to be fees and funding related. Spokesperson for the University, Zandile Mbabela, says there is also protest action at its George Campus. “We monitor the situation on the ground. Staff and students are advised to liaise with their line managers and lecturers, respectively on how best to proceed with the day’s operations and academic activities. We have also asked staff and students to keep an eye out on the university’s official communication platforms where more information will be shared.”
