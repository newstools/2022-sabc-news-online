The African National Congress (ANC) in the Eastern Cape has expressed shock at the attempted murder of its Ward 42 branch leader, Mazwi Mini, in the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. The ANC says in a statement it is aware that a threat was made against Mini during a branch meeting a week ago, warning him about his behaviour and preference in the run-up to the provincial conference. ANC Provincial Secretary Lulama Ngcukayitobi has urged ANC members to prevent rogue and criminal elements from hijacking party processes. Two shots were fired into Mini’s house in Kwanobuhle on Saturday night, wounding him in the jaw. The regional spokesperson of the ANC, Lukhanyo Mzinzi, says they don’t want to speculate on the motive of the shooting. “We want to allow space to the police to investigate, we don’t want to predict an outcome. We are surprised. We note this with a very fine eye. …We recently went to a Congress and there was no violence, a Congress that was highly contested by there was no violence. We want to denounce this,” says Mzinzi.
