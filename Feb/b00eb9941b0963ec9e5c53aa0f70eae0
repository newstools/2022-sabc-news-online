Single-use plastics such as straws, utensils, and containers will be banned across Chile starting Sunday (February 13th) when a new law comes into effect. Aimed at reducing plastic pollution, the new regulations will curb 23,000 tonnes of plastics every year, according to Chile’s Deputy Environment Minister, Marcelo Fernandez. The law stipulates a three-year period for restaurants and other food vendors to shift from the plastic and polystyrene containers and items they provide to their customers into biodegradable materials. According to 2018 data from the World Bank, Chile generates the second-largest amount of garbage among Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America, just behind Mexico.
