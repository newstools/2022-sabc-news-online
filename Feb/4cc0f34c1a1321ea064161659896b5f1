The EFF Student Command at three FET Colleges in Limpopo have staged a protest march at the Letaba FET college in Tzaneen to call for the admission of students who have failed their Pre Vocational Learning Programme, or PLP. The student command has accused college management at the Maake, Giyani and Modjadji campuses of refusing to register students and denying them the opportunity to proceed to the National Certificate Vocational programme. Some protestors believe that the programme is a bridging course that should not be used as a requirement for admission. “Management are refusing to register students who have failed PLP now these students want to go to do level two. We are protesting because they deny us access to school because they are saying we failed PLP according to us PLP is just a one year course. And They told us PLP is a bridging course for next year and if  you never got  space this year, if you do PLP,  next year you gonna qualify.” Principal at the three FET colleges, Pule Mashele says their admission policy does not allow students who fail the PLP to proceed and students are instead advised to repeat the programme. “You need to pass the caps test or P and or PLP in this regard those students performed very bad last year  in the Cap test and the matter is clear let them pass the Cap test or the PLP of which  we cannot move away from the policy.” The EFF student command have vowed to continue with the protest if their demands are not met.
