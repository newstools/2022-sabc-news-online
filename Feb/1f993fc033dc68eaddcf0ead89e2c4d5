Eskom says it will once again implement stage 2  rolling blackouts from 9 pm on Monday evening until 5 am on Tuesday. The power utility says this is to conserve and replenish emergency reserves. Eskom Spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha says further breakdowns could force the power utility to implement blackouts sooner or to extend it beyond Tuesday morning. “Since midnight we have lost the unit each at Camden, Kusile, Duvha and Matla power stations. Furthermore, the return of a unit at Kusile and two units at Majuba power stations are delayed. Total breakdowns amount to 16 261MW while planned maintenance is 5 350MW of capacity as we continue with the reliability maintenance. Eskom appeals to all South Africans to reduce the usage of electricity and to switch off non-essential items,” says Mantshantsha. Full statement:
