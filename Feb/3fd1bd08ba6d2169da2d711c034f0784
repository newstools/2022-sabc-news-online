The case of perjury against former Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini has been postponed to the 9th of March. This is when Magistrate Betty Khumalo will hand down judgment on the case. Dlamini, who is also the African National Congress Women’s League President, appeared in the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, where her lawyers put forward arguments on why she must not be found guilty on the charges. She allegedly lied under oath during the inquiry into the South African Social Security Agency grant crisis in 2017, headed by retired Judge Bernard Ngoepe. ANC Women’s League members picket outside court to support Bathabile Dlamini:  Following a number of postponements of the trial due to logistical challenges, which included non-arrival of witnesses in court, the trial continues on Wednesday. Magistrate Betty Khumalo will decide Dlamini’s fate on the matter. It is expected that African National Congress heavyweights, including Supra Mahumapelo, Carl Niehaus and Ace Magashule, will be in attendance during these court proceedings. Dismissed In December last year, the court dismissed Dlamini’s application to have her acquitted in her perjury case. In November, former SASSA CEO Thokozani Magwaza gave evidence that Dlamini often interfered with the internal operations of the agency. According to State Advocate Jacob Serepo, the first witness in the case, SASSA Regional Executive Manager in the North West Zodwa Mvulane, had failed to respond to messages on numerous occasions despite being subpoenaed and was moving between Limpopo and the North West. Defence Advocate Tshepiso Phahlane opposed the application for the matter to be remanded saying the reasons advanced are purely administrative.
