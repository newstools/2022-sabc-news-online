The South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) has reiterated that the authorisation of the Sinopharm vaccine is subject to a number of conditions. These include that the jab is supplied in accordance with the national COVID-19 vaccination programme. The Chinese-made two-dose vaccine was registered at the end of last month and deemed fit for use on adults aged 18 years and older. SAHPRA has also registered the Comirnaty vaccine, made by Pfizer Laboratories. The regulator’s CEO Dr Boitumelo Semete says, “We still have to look at the safety of the vaccine and also look at the quality of it, is the facility where it was manufactured compliant with standards, etc.” “The Sinopharm vaccine has an efficacy of 79%, which is still very acceptable. The global requirement according to the WHO (World Health Organisation) is 50% – so it is way above that and we were satisfied with the vaccine efficacy,” adds Semete. In May last year, the World Health Organisation approved the Sinopharm vaccine for COVID-19 emergencies.

Government and other health stakeholders have continued to urge those who have not received their vaccines to do so. People who received the second dose of their Pfizer jab at least six months ago can now get their booster shot. Johnson and Johnson’s booster vaccines are available to those who received their first J&J shot at least two months ago. Meanwhile, the National Department of Health says the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases identified in SA is 3 625 190 with 1 228 new cases reported.
