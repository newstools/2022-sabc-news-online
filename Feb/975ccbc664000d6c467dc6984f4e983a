February 4 marks the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the South African Constitution. This after the late former President Nelson Mandela signed the final draft Constitution into law on December 10, 1996. The Constitution has already been amended 17 times since it came into effect. Although the Constitution was signed into law in December 1996, this Act 108 of  Parliament only came into effect on February 4, 1997. Lauded as one of the most progressive in the world, the adoption of South Africa’s Constitution heralded the intention to make a clear break from the country’s apartheid past towards a future that promised human rights and dignity for all. It was only after the implementation of the 1996 Constitution that the 25-year-old National Council of Provinces was legally established to replace the then senate. The 25th commemoration of the Constitution also coincides with the interview of a Constitutional Court Justice, Raymond Zondo, who will be interviewed for the top position of Chief Justice of South Africa. He is one of four candidates being interviewed for the Chief Justice post. The other candidates are Constitutional Court Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga, Supreme Court of Appeal President Mandisa Maya and Judge President of the Gauteng High Court Division, Dunstan Mlambo. The Constitution drastically transformed the legal, political, social and economic landscape of the country. At the time, the government asserted that the crafting of a vision for a new democratic South Africa, reflected in the Constitution, was a deliberate choice. The esteem the South African constitution enjoys is largely due to its attempt to give effect to citizens’ socio-economic rights. Besides human and political rights, Chapter 2 guarantees the right to housing, health care, food, water and education amongst others.
