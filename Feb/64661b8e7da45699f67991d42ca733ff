The South African Civil unrest which broke out in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng on the 9 July 2021, was sparked by the imprisonment of former President Jacob Zuma for contempt of court. In the days following the unrest, 18 people were arrested for allegedly instigating the July unrest in 2021, with Mbongeni Clarence Tabane, Sibusiso Mavuso, Ngizwe Mchunu, Mdumiseni Khetha Zuma, Bonginkosi Khanyile, Zamaswazi Zinhle Majozi, Advocate Ike Khumalo, Joe Bernington Mabaso and Bruce Nimmerhoudt arrested and charged with inciting public violence in the recent unrest in Gauteng. They have all been released on bail, excluding Mdumiseni Khetha Zuma, who faces two charges of contravening Section 17 of the Riotous Assemblies Act by inciting others to commit public violence. He’s facing charges of arson and incitement for his alleged role in the violence. Zuma was denied bail in October 2021. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said all cases against the alleged instigators were postponed for further investigations. Cabinet also revealed that damages to properties caused by the July Unrest are expected to cost the South African Special Risks Insurance Association (Sasria) between R15 billion to R20 billion in claims. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
