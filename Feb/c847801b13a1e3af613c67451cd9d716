The African National Congress (ANC) in the Free State says former President Thabo Mbeki’s three-day visit to the province will assist in the process of unity and renewal. Mbeki’s visit comes at a time when the party is closing cracks caused by divisions dating back from 2012. The province has an Interim Provincial Committee led by Mxolisi Dukwana after the Supreme Court of Appeal verdict which disbanded the leadership and found it unconstitutional. The former President will visit the province from February 17-19. ANC Interim Provincial Committee spokesperson Oupa Khoabane says the wisdom of Mbeki will assist in defending and advancing South Africa’s democratic gains. “We are trying to break the vicious cycle that has been in the province for close to three decades. We are trying to ensure that we turn things around. As we do that, we don’t [want to] come up with things that will be temporally but things that we think will bring the necessary impact in the mandate that we have been given by the National Executive Committee,” says Khoabane.
