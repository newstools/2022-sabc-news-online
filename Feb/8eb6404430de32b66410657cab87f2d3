Donald Trump’s new social media venture, Truth Social, launched late on Sunday (February 20) in Apple’s App Store, potentially marking the former president’s return to social media after he was banned from several platforms last year. The app was available to download shortly before midnight ET and was automatically downloaded to Apple Inc AAPL.O devices belonging to users who had pre-ordered the app. Some users reported either having trouble registering for an account or were added to a waitlist with a message: “Due to massive demand, we have placed you on our waitlist.” The app has been available for people invited to use it during its test phase, Reuters previously reported. Trump was banned from Twitter Inc, Facebook and Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL.O YouTube following the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by his supporters, after he was accused of posting messages inciting violence.
