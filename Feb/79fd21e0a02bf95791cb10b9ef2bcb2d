A group of civic organisations and small-scale fishermen are staging a picket outside the High Court in Cape Town where an urgent interdict against an ongoing seismic survey off the West Coast is due to be heard. Survey company Searcher Geodata UK and its Australian subsidiary are opposing the urgent interdict application. A seismic survey involves blasting sound waves into the sea with air guns. The strategic lead for the sustainable development NGO, Green Connection, Liz McDaid, says the survey could cause irreparable harm to marine life. “We believe that the seismic survey can cause irreparable harm to the marine life and if we upset and disrupt the ecosystem then it can also potentially lead to a disruption in the fish stocks. This can also then lead to hardship and an impact on the livelihoods of coastal fishers all around.”
