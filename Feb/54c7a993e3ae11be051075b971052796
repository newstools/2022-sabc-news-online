The DA in the Northern Cape is at pains to stop the decline of their support following their drop from 24.85% to 19% in the November local government elections. Strategies and interventions were thrashed out during the party’s two-day extended provincial council held in Kimberley. DA Federal Council Chairperson Helen Zille, who was in attendance, says the party’s preparations for the 2024 elections have kicked off. “The future is a post-ANC future. The ANC dominance of the SA political landscape has come to an end and that is what 2021 showed us. All eyes are now on 2024. The campaign for 2024 has begun in earnest and I will be in sol Plaatje, Kimberley often in the months ahead to support Harold in getting us in top shape for that crucial general election,” says Zille. The DA leader in the Northern Cape, Harold McGluwa has blamed the mushrooming of new political parties for the decline in DA support across the province. The party is holding an extended provincial council in Kimberley in preparation for the 2024 national elections. “The party has dropped in terms of percentage. Yes indeed, from 24 to 19, but also we have to take into account that there were a number of factors that played the role. We have seen almost 37 formations and political parties within the province contesting the 2021 local government elections. And also there were a number of formations that stood up like civic movements. And it’s not only the DA that dropped,” McGluwa elaborates.
