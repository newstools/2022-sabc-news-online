Over 300 people lost their lives during the July unrest of 2021 in KwaZulu-Natal and parts of Gauteng. The widespread riots are believed to have been sparked by the arrest of former President Jacob Zuma. Police also lifted the lid on the racial tensions and alleged racial killings that flared up in Phoenix, north of Durban, where over 30 people were killed during the racial tensions that erupted during the unrest in the area. A total of 22 suspects have since been arrested in connection with the Phoenix violence, according to the police. Cabinet also revealed that damages to properties caused by the July Unrest are expected to cost the South African Special Risks Insurance Association (Sasria) between R15 billion to R20 billion in claims. Meanwhile, the Gauteng government revealed that the economic cost of the riots in the province stood at R5 billion, with 18 000 jobs lost, while over 30 000 jobs were lost in KwaZulu-Natal alone. Eighty out of 500 shopping malls in Gauteng were looted and vandalised during the unrest, small businesses including spaza shops were also attacked. The National Empowerment Fund (NEF) and the Solidarity Fund established an R450 million SMME Support Programme for businesses that suffered losses during the spate of violent protests that engulfed the two provinces. Department of Trade, Industry and Competition (DTIC) approved an R1.5 billion to support businesses affected by the looting and unrest in July of last year.
