The provincial head of Stats SA in the North West says they are working closely with institutions operating special dwellings, including prisons and hospitals, to collate the counting of all residents in these facilities. Census Night will also see officials counting truck drivers in transit, homeless people and those in guesthouses and hotels. Census 2011 indicated that the North West had a population of over 3,5 million people and at the time, showed significant growth of non-citizens living in the province. “We are basically preparing that by tomorrow, when we come to such institutions, we are going to get the full record of all the people that slept all these institutions, the hotels, the guest houses, hospitals, including those that will be sleeping in the police cells, including the prisoners,” says Selemela. Selemela says Stats SA has ensured the safety of enumerators. “Our field workers are very safe. We spoke to people at the security cluster. They will be protecting our field workers and the other thing is that the gadget they are having they are tagged and they are monitored,” Selemela adds.
