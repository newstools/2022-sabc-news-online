President Cyril Ramaphosa says the National State of Disaster will soon be done away with. Currently, the country is on Alert Level 1 of the national lockdown. However, speaking during his State of the Nation Address at the Cape Town City Hall, Ramaphosa said so far all restrictions emanating from the lockdown regulations have been lifted. He says government still has to finalise some measures before an announcement is made to deal with all lockdown regulations. “We are now ready to enter a new phase in our management of the pandemic, it is our intention and also my clear intention to end the National State of Disaster, we will do so as soon as we have finalised other measures under the National Health Act as well as other legislation to manage and contain the pandemic, this we have to do,” says Ramaphosa.
