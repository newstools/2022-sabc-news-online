The prosecution says it is more than ready to start with the trial of Mackenzie Ratselane. Ratselane, a former police officer, is accused of the attempted murder of his then-wife Lesedi FM Current Affairs Anchor Dimakatso Folotsi. His trial is set to start on Monday after he was arrested in Gauteng last year a week after being on the run after he allegedly stabbed Folotsi multiple times and left her for dead at an informal settlement in Bloemfontein. He is facing five charges that include attempted murder, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, kidnapping, possession of illegal firearm and possession of illegal ammunition. Free State NPA Spokesperson, Phaladi Shuping says, “The NPA has been ready since May, but unfortunately, the defense has requested several postponements, which is why the matter has not yet been finalised, or we have not started with the trial. The trial is set for three days and we hope that tomorrow when we start with the trial, there won’t be any request for postponement and all the parties will proceed with the matter because we want to see the matter being finalised as soon as possible.” Gender-based violence | Organisations protest attack on Lesedi FM anchor Dimakatso Ratselane:
