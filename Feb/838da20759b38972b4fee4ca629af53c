Chairperson of the South African Wind Energy Association, Mercia Grimbeek, says more skills development programmes are needed for women who work in the renewable energy sector. She says women who work in the sector can perform key roles in middle and senior management structures in renewable energy companies if they receive the right training. Grimbeek was speaking during a plenary session at the Solar Power Africa Conference, which is being held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre. The theme of the session was gender empowerment in the renewable energy sector. She says the role of women needs to be advanced in the sector. “We are launching the Gender Diversity Charter, which really is aligned to the Ministerial Advisory Committee on gender and through that we will be looking at various interactions, between ourselves and the other associations to have leadership courses, dialogues and really advance the role of women in the industry.” Solar project Last month, the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research introduced a massive solar array project that will help support government’s national Integrated Resource Plan to co-ordinate renewable energy research and development. The CSIR is looking to secure 8 million kilowatts by 2030. This will temper the energy crisis in the country by using renewable energy to provide electricity to the national grid.
