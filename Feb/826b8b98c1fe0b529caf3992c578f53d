Angry parents of learners from Relebogile primary school in Swartdam outside Soshanguve north of Pretoria, are demanding that a new school which was promised to them in 2017 be constructed. They say their current school is 70 years old and severely dilapidated. Parents are accusing the North West Education Department of ignoring the concerns they have been raising for years. “The condition that the school it is, our kids are attending at is not good for them, the school is so old,. Last year the other one was shuttered down by the wind, so the kids can’t go back to school due to lack of classes.” The department’s spokesperson Elias Malindi says they are finalising the process of appointing a building contractor. Malindi says the school will be completed in the next financial year. “We are aware about this matter, because as department we can indicate that other delays, were caused by the eruption of COVID 19, we have a process of outsourcing for service providers and so on, currently we’ve appointed a consultant who is busy with the drawing of the school, which we are going to make sure that once it is complete then we moved to another phase.”
