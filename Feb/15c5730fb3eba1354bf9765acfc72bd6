Factionalism, patronage and ill-discipline within the African National Congress (ANC) dominated speeches by various speakers at COSATU’s 6th Provincial Congress at Potchefstroom in the North West. The two-day elective congress which ends on Friday also reflected on the current state of affairs within politics and governance in the province. During his opening address, COSATU’S provincial chairperson, Solly Lekhu, called on the ANC Interim Provincial Committee (IPC) to act decisively on members who are ill-disciplined. “The ANC in the province is characterised by a high level of ill-discipline. We have seen some leaders considering themselves popular. They are in a competition to outdo and outshine others. The IPC in the province is not helping the situation. They have been left wanting when they must mute out discipline on rogue members. The IPC must act and must act without fear or favour.” SACP Provincial Secretary, Madoda Sambatha, echoed the same sentiments “North West is a highly factionalised province. Factionalism rules in North West, money and patronage are the daily activities into convincing people who to vote for.  So if you dream of leading, the first thing that you must do is not forming a branch, find money for you to buy the branch – that is the ANC of today.” #COSATU Deputy General Secretary,   Solly Phetoe addressed Limpopo Provincial Congress held at the Bolivia Lodge in Polokwane #WorkersControl #ClassConsciousness #COSATUProvCongresses @FullViewSABC @SABCNews @eNCA @Newzroom405 @Radio702 @ewnupdates @Ukhozi_CA @CapricornFMNews pic.twitter.com/54lGI9yTd5 — @COSATU Today (@_cosatu) February 10, 2022
