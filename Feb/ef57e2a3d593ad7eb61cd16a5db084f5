The search to find a mother and child who have been swept away by the Mvoti River north of Durban has been launched. Lifeguards, a paramedic team, as well as a SAPS search and rescue unit and police divers are taking part in the search. Witnesses told the authorities that the mother was trying to cross the fast-flowing river with her baby when the incident occurred. Medi Response team spokesperson Paul Herbst says, “Reports from the scene indicate that a mother, with her baby on her back, was crossing the flowing river when they were both swept away. Witnesses to the incident managed to get to safety and to call for help…” “Rescue teams have deployed the Medi Response drone as well as search and rescue K9’s across the area. At this stage, there have been no positive results and the search is ongoing,” added Herbst.
