Statistics South Africa says the safety of citizens from COVID-19 and possible criminal elements will be a top priority when over 160 field workers are deployed to various areas of the country for the 2022 Census. The fourth population tally will run from February 3-28. Household registration for the country’s first digital Census began last week and will end on Friday.
