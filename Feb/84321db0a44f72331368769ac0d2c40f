Deputy Minister in the Presidency, Thembi Siweya, has urged South Africans and everyone within the borders of the country to cooperate with field workers of Statistics South Africa sent out to count them. The Census 2022 programme kicked off on the third of this month and will end on the 28th. A Census is held every ten years in South Africa. Stats SA says this is the first census to be conducted both online and using face-to-face enumeration. Siweya says all sectors of society rely on Census for their planning. “Everyone within the borders of South Africa needs to be counted. The 3rd of February was the census night launch. We went to O.R Tambo International Airport where we counted those who were commuting in and outside the country. If you’re in South Africa it doesn’t matter what your race is, nationality, legality it doesn’t matter what your status is, as long as you’re a human being as long as you were within our borders by the 3rd of February they are coming to count you. The process is underway,” says Thembi Siweya. Make sure you know how to identify a census fieldworker.
