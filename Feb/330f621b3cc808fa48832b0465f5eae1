The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres has warned that there is no alternative to diplomacy over Russia’s possible military invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Guterres was speaking in New York after speaking with the Foreign ministers of Russia and Ukraine earlier Monday. He called for the UN Charter to be respected, pointing to language that all members should settle their international disputes through peaceful means. Guterres’ remarks come at a time that the United States is warning of the possibility of an imminent attack. In pointed remarks, he said he was deeply worried about heightened tensions and increased speculation around a potential military conflict in Europe, warning of a high price in human suffering, destruction and damage to European and global security. His remarks come amid a flurry of diplomatic activity from Western nations to stave off a possible military escalation with over 100 000 Russian troops in addition to military hardware stationed near Ukraine’s borders. Guterres warned that abandoning diplomacy for confrontation would not just be a step over the line but “a drive over a cliff.”

UN urges diplomacy to ease tensions over Ukraine:  Swift and decisive measures The United States continues to promise swift and decisive measures if Russia invades Ukraine. President Joe Biden spoke telephonically with both his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts over the weekend, but without any immediate breakthrough. Washington believes there could be an attack any time this week, ordering most of its Embassy staff to leave the Ukrainian capital Kiev. The Pentagon also withdrew about 150 military trainers from the country. However, Russia’s Foreign Minister is still pushing for diplomacy within his government, to get concessions from the West over Moscow’s security concerns in Eastern Europe.
