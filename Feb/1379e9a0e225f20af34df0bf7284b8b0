A 16-year-old boy has been shot and killed in Bonteheuwel on the Cape Flats. Police spokesperson Andre Traut says the shooter is unknown at this stage. The circumstances of the murder are being investigated. Bonteheuwel ward councillor Angus McKenzie says the shooting was an alleged gang-related incident that started with stone-throwing. “Law enforcement agencies were immediately deployed to the area and had to come between rival gangs throwing stones and shooting live ammunition, this after a 16-year-old alleged to be involved in the stone-throwing was shot in the head by a rival gangster. He was immediately transported to hospital and later succumbed to his injuries.” Meanwhile, in the Eastern Cape, a case of attempted murder is being investigated after a former Nelson Mandela Bay councillor Mazwi Mini was shot and wounded at his Kwanobuhle home on Saturday night. According to police, two shots were fired into his home from the street by unknown suspects. He was taken to hospital for treatment for a bullet wound to the jaw. Mazwi is also a member of the ANC. The party has expressed its disbelief at the incident calling for swift and effective action by law enforcement agencies. ANC regional secretary Loyulo Nqakula says violence and gangsterism have no place in the community.
