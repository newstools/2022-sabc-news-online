Environmental group, Green Connection, has welcomed the  High Court’s dismissal of oil giant Shell’s application for leave to appeal the December interim interdict against its seismic survey along the wild coast. Communities along the wild coast approached the Court to stop thesurvey saying not all legal prescripts were adhered to in awarding the exploration rights. The application for leave to appeal was dismissed with costs. Strategic lead for Green Connection, Liziwe Mcdaid says this is the second victory for fishing communities on both the East and West coasts. “Green Connection is pleased with the Court outcome on the wild coast Shell matter. Shell has applied for leave to appeal against the interdict and that was denied that means the seismic ban remains and this is good news for coastal communities of the wild coast. In the meantime, we are glad the west coast seismic ban remains in place and we are now going to be looking at the merits of the cases,” says Liziwe Mcdaid.
