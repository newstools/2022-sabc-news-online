The Office of the Public Protector has issued a statement seeking to set the record straight regarding its appointment of Luther Lebelo as Chief of Staff. Lebelo allegedly helped oversee former SARS Commissioner Tom Moyane’s controversial stint at the tax agency. Lebelo has been hired on a two-year fixed-term contract and reports directly to Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. Public Protector Spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says a rigorous vetting process was carried out ahead of offering Lebelo the job. And this included criminal, qualification and reference checks. He says they’ve also learned that Lebelo and SARS parted ways on the basis of a mutual separation agreement. “Except for commentary and remarks about Mr. Lebelo and a recommendation that he be disciplined for an opinion piece carried in the Business Day newspaper in 2016, an issue for which he was disciplined, there is no adverse finding against him in the Nugent Commission Report. Moreover, there is no mention of his name in the part of the State Capture Commission Report dealing with SARS-related matters. Information of the findings of the two commissions is public. It is therefore unclear why all the innuendos,” says Oupa Segalwe. VIDEO: Luther Lebelo testifies at the SARS inquiry
