The Judge who presided over the Nomia Rosemary Ndovu murder trial has passed on. Judge Ramarumo Monama recently sentenced the former police officer to six life sentences for orchestrating the murders of her partner and five family members in order to claim insurance payouts. Monama passed away on Thursday following a short illness. The Judge had presided over a number of high-profile cases including that of the Thulsie twins, Nataniel Julies, and the historic Ahmed Timol inquest. Monama has been a Judge in the Gauteng Division since 2010. He was a founding member of the Centre for Applied Legal Studies – South Africa’s oldest human rights and public interest legal center.
