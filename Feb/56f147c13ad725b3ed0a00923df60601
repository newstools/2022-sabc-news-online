A medical Non-Governmental Organisation Pediatric Care Africa, which was established five years ago has commenced with its third annual “Ride for a Child” initiative across the country. The planned 7000 kilometres ride intends to raise funds for underprivileged children in need of medical care and surgeries. The month-long ride started in White River in Mpumalanga on Sunday last week and is expected to round the country, heading to different provinces. Founder of the organisation and a retired medical doctor Dr. Andre Hattingh says more than 100 children have benefited from this ride, with many still expected to receive the needed medical assistance “First Ride For a Child, the very first one in 2020 was much smaller than it is now. Of course it was our first one. Then we managed to collect enough money to do four surgeries and we managed to collect enough money to take just over 100 children to see a specialist.” The organization wants to take 70 children in South Africa for surgeries and to take 400 children in South Africa to see medical specialists. All in all we want to take this year about 2200 children to see medical specialists.” The organisation is also assisting with food donations. Some parents of beneficiaries say they welcome the help. “Dr. Andre has helped us a lot with food and when my children are sick. I could not have asked for more.” “Dr. Andre has been helping us for a long time. If it was not for him I don’t know where we would be. I just want to thank Dr. Andre for everything that he is helping our grandchild with. We appreciate it” says another parent. “Ride for a Child” initiative to raise funds for underprivileged children in need of medical care
