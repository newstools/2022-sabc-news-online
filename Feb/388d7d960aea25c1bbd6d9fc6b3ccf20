A nurse who was gunned down allegedly by her police officer boyfriend will be laid to rest at Marulaneng village in Mokopane in Limpopo on Saturday. Thirty year-year-old Lebogang Monene was shot and killed at Tembisa hospital last week. Her alleged killer turned the gun on himself, and is believed to be still in hospital. Monene was a nurse at the Tembisa hospital since 2016. Her ex-boyfriend entered the hospital using a state vehicle. Eyewitnesses say the two argued at the parking lot before the shooting.  The man also shot himself but is recovering in hospital.  He faces a charge of murder. Meanwhile, a five kilometer walk, prayer meeting and dialogue around gender based violence will take place in Tembisa, on Gauteng’s east rand on Saturday. This, a week after Monene was gunned down. Tembisa is among the areas identified as a GBV crime hotspot in the country. The event starts at 10am and will be attended by various government, faith based and community representatives.
