Classes will remain suspended until Thursday at Hoerskool Jan Viljoen in Randfontein, on Gauteng’s West Rand. Pupils at the school were turned back on Tuesday morning following Monday’s flare-up of racial tensions between black and white parents. Police used rubber bullets in an attempt to calm the situation. Last week, a video showing black and white learners fighting went viral, resulting in provincial education authorities meeting with the school management, educators and learners. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi visited the school on Monday for a report on the incident that happened on Friday. There will be a parent meeting on Thursday regarding the matter.
