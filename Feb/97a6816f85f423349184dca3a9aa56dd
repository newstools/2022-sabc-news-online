KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala says part of the challenges the province is facing are ageing infrastructure and communities who are still in need of piped water. Zikalala is at the opening of the Provincial Annual Planning Lekgotla underway in Durban. The lekgotla is a high-level strategic meeting and takes place ahead of the State of the Province Address (SOPA). It will be attended by all MEC’s, as well as Mayors, the Directors-General, head of departments, planning commissioners, municipal managers, state-owned entities, and the chairperson of the Provincial House of Traditional Leadership. Zikalala started by unpacking some of the challenges the province has experienced – including the July unrest, the impact of COVID-19 and increasing crime. Among the key areas of focus will be on assessing the provincial efforts to combat COVID-19, arresting the crime wave in the province, progress on the implementation of key service delivery projects, the state of water provision in KZN, economic recovery and job creation interventions.
