The mother of a young woman from George, who’s been convicted on drug charges in Thailand, says they’re doing their utmost to assist her legally and help bring her back home. Twenty-two-year-old Ashley Oosthuizen left South Africa straight out of high school in 2018 to teach English overseas. Shortly after starting work, she was arrested in a police sting operation after signing for a package containing drugs. She was imprisoned in 2020 and received the death penalty which was commuted to a life sentence. Her mother, Lynnette Blignaut, says the appeal process can take between eight and 14 months. “I’ve spoken to her on Friday morning. She is being held in a juvenile prison in the south of Thailand and she’s in good spirits, she’s in good health. I do have my lawyers and they have appealed. So, it was extended about 3 times and eventually it was handed into court in December,” says Blignaut.
