The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education says most of the learners who inhaled gas that leaked from one of the factories in Richards Bay have been discharged from hospital. Over 40 learners from Richards Bay High School and John Ross College were rushed to hospital on Monday after several children experienced nausea, vomiting or breathing problems. The Provincial Education spokesperson Muzi Mahlambi says, “All of them were treated and discharged, but only one child remained hospitalised yesterday. There were two schools that were affected – John Ross School was also affected – but except for the 1 child that remained hospitalised, all of them were ok and the school is ready to resume teaching and learning this morning. We are engaging emergency agencies in the area on the matter.” <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span>
