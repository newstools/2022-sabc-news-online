The Peter Mokaba, Vhembe, Sekhukhune and Waterberg regions in Limpopo have endorsed provincial Chairperson Stan Mathabatha for a third term. Only the Mopani region has not supported Mathabatha for a third term. The two regions held their Regional Executive Council to announce their preferred candidates for the party’s Provincial Elective Conference to be held in June. Speaking during the Regional Executive Council in Polokwane, Chairperson of the Peter Mokaba Region John Mpe says for stability and continuity they have confidence in the leadership of the current Chairperson. Mpe says, “For the continuity and stabilisation of the organisation we believe in the provincial leadership led by provincial Chairperson comrade Stanley Chupu Mathabatha, Comrade Florence Radzilani could continue to deputise, comrade Danny Msiza could be the provincial Secretary, the Deputy Secretary of the province could continue, our own regional Treasurer.” In 2020, Mathabatha condemned the looting of personal protective equipment (PPEs) resources, saying the law must deal with the criminal behaviour of people who are looting resources meant to fight the coronavirus (COVID-19). He said, “The reports that people have been lining their pockets including the pockets of their family members and relatives with money meant to fight the virus have been looting state resources that were meant to provide food to the needy families and personal protective equipments to frontline officials, particularly our health care workers, this is unacceptable criminal behaviour which must be dealt with the full might of law.”
