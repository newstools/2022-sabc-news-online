President Cyril Ramaphosa has emphasized the benefits of good governance on the continent in his weekly letter to the nation on Monday. This is as South Africa’s chairship of the African Peer Review Forum (APRM ) ended this last weekend. The Forum, which enjoys the membership of 42 of the African Union’s 55 member states, is a voluntary mechanism by countries to promote human rights, consolidate democracy and improve governance. South Africa which joined the APRM has been assessed twice with challenges identified including rising inequality and unemployment, incidents of xenophobia, and poor service delivery. Ramaphosa says good governance brings investment, development, peace, and shared prosperity. Just as South Africa’s fortunes are inextricably tied to those of the continent, we are also affected by political, economic and other forms of instability in Africa. This makes our participation in the African Peer Review Mechanism all the more critical. https://t.co/bpoQL9dELt pic.twitter.com/r3tKonFE65 — Cyril Ramaphosa  (@CyrilRamaphosa) February 7, 2022  Below is the full letter from the president:
