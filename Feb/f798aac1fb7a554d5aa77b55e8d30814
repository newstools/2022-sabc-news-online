Trade union Giwusa has met with Clover workers in Polokwane who are on a nationwide strike against salary cuts and retrenchments. Giwusa President, Mametlwe Sebei says the company and workers are still not in agreement on a number of issues. Sebei says that the strike has achieved some of the demands, like the reinstatement of workers who were retrenched in November. He says today’s visit in Polokwane was to encourage workers to continue fighting until their demands are met. “The workers resolved to continue and intensified the strike, for them to remain on the picket line, and to show that our picket lines are solid, up until our demands are met, and aspiration fulfilled (sic). We have been engaging with management of Clover with, particularly Department of Trade and Industry, and part of the purpose of the meeting was to give them a report of the status of that,” says Mametlwe Sebei.
