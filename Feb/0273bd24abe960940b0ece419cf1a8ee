The Mpumalanga Division of the High Court in Mbombela is expected to sentence the convicted Masoyi serial killer, Julius Mndawe. Mndawe was found guilty of murder and defeating the ends of justice. He was arrested for killing and burying five women in his yard at Numbi village near Hazyview in 2019. The women aged between 15 and 24 were killed between 2018 and 2019. Police arrested him after a cellular phone of one of the victims was found in his possession in 2019. He pleaded guilty to the murder but told the court that the murders were not premeditated, however, the investigating officer emphasised that the manner in which the graves were found suggests that the murders were premeditated. Mndawe found guilty of murder:  Families call for a harsh sentence Family members of the victims were happy with the court outcome and are calling on the court to give Mndawe a sentence that will send a clear message to other murderers. They say they will not accept his apology. “We don’t accept his apology. We won’t be able to forgive him for now because we are very hurt and we have lost our loved ones. We are still pained even now,” added some family members. Mndawe’s family says he should apologise to the families of the women he has admitted to killing. His father, Frank Mndawe, says the family is still in shock. “We were shocked when we heard about the alleged incident. We are still saddened by his actions. We had hoped as a family that we would also receive counselling. We do not know anything about what he did because he lived in his own house, not with us. They burned down his house and we accept that because what he did was wrong.”
