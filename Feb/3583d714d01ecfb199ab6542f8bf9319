Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Piet Koen has dismissed the application for leave to appeal the dismissal of former President Jacob Zuma’s special plea in his corruption case. Handing down judgement in this matter, Koen told the court that resorting to an appeal while the matter is heading to trial is not in the interest of justice. Zuma’s legal team filed an application for leave to appeal in January. This after Koen dismissed Zuma’s application for the recusal of lead prosecutor, Advocate Billy Downer. Judge Koen says the criminal trial should start on the 11th of April as he ruled in 2021. Earlier, some supporters of former President Jacob Zuma, members of his family and former Umkhonto we Sizwe Veterans Association spokesperson Carl Niehaus had arrived at the court.
