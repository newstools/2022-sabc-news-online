African National Congress (ANC) Chairperson in the Northern Cape Dr Zamani Saul says internal battles within the party make it unattractive to voters and supporters. Saul was speaking during the party’s two-day virtual PEC Legotla in the Northern Cape where he maintained the party’s dismal performance during the local government elections could have been avoided. The ANC in the Northern Cape received a 50,55 percentage support during the 2021 municipal elections – a decline from the 58,26% in 2016. He says the provincial ANC lekgotla should find ways in dealing with the disunity within the party as they prepare for the 2024 elections. “Voters want a united and focused ANC. Voters want a working alliance. Our internal battles make the movement very unattractive to our supporters. The more we fight, the more unattractive we become. So, the biggest challenge for now is to ensure that we work very hard in building unity within our ranks.” Build up to the ANC 55th elective conference gains momentum
