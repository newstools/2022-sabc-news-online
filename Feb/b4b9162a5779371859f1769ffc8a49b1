Gauteng Social Development MEC Morakane Mosupyoe says she has sent a team to investigate allegations of the abuse of the elderly at the Mohlakeng Old Age home in Randfontein, west of Johannesburg. Some of the staff have alleged that an elderly person recently died after being bitten by rats. They also allege that the elderly are fed expired and rotten food. They also allege that relatives of the owner of the home are using a minibus-taxi, which should be used to take the senior citizens to hospitals for medical check-ups, for personal trips. Five staff members have been suspended for exposing the alleged abuses to the media. Mosupyoe says the abuse of the elderly will not be tolerated. “Drastic steps will be taken. So, obviously, we work within the law in South Africa. And if we have evidence and I suspect there is, people can’t just make allegations for nothing.  We are going to have to withdraw the support we give the NGO. They will be given an opportunity to give their story on the table but the investigation is going to be made. But what is important is the protection of the elderly. We will remove what causes them distress.” Efforts to get comment from the NGO have so far been unsuccessful.
