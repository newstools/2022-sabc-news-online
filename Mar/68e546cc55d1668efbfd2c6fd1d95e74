The Walter Sisulu Local Municipality, in the Eastern Cape, has injected R3 million to fix the streets of Mzomhle township in Burgersdorp. Mayor Vania Davids says the rehabilitation of the road infrastructure is to respond to the key socio-economic needs of the residents. Davids says the street rehabilitation programme will create jobs for the unemployed youth in the area. “It will have some job opportunities for the community,”says Davids. Davids says they are aware of the high unemployment rate in the area. “We have local workers within the jurisdiction of Walter Sisulu doing the work so that they are able to claim,”says Davids.
