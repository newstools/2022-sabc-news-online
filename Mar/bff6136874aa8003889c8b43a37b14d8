South African sprinter, Thando Dlodlo, has been retrospectively banned for two and half years after testing positive for testosterone and its related compounds. The South African Institute for Drug-Free Sport has confirmed the ban. Dlodlo participated in the World Athletics Relay Championships in Poland in May last year alongside Akani Simbine, Gift Leotlela and Clarence Munyai. South Africa won the four-by-100 metres relay after beating favourites Brazil. His positive test now means that South Africa has been stripped of that gold medal. Dlodlo’s sample in question was retrieved at the SA National Championships in April last year, just before the Tokyo Olympic Games.
