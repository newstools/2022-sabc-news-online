Mpumalanga is hosting over 90 crafters from the country’s nine provinces at the Beautiful Things 2022 exhibition taking place at the Graskop Gorge. The crafters are showcasing their handmade work from ceramics, beadwork, wirework, glasswork and fabric painting amongst others. Meetings Africa 2022 seeks to grow the business events industry in Africa:  One of the artists, Margaret Mahlangu, says COVID-19 has disrupted their business and such opportunities will assist to revive them. “My late grandmother used to do beadwork for mats. My business almost died because of COVID-19, people were not buying then, there was no money. “So it was not really easy for us to get funding. I’m glad about this opportunity. Thanks so much Beautiful Things and the Department of Arts and Culture,” adds Mahlangu.
