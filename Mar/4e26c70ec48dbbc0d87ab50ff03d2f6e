The lawyer representing 130 City of Johannesburg employees whose contracts end at the end of next month says the notices given to them have several procedural defects. Mojalefa Motalane was briefing the media in Johannesburg on the workers’ intention to institute legal action against the City. Last month the Joburg City Council resolved to rescind a decision by the previous African National Congress (ANC) led administration’s mayoral committee to convert the workers’ fixed-term contracts to permanent ones. The multi-party government in Johannesburg has described the process as irregular and unlawful. It says the workers’ contracts have been regularised and will run their course, coming to an end at the end of April 2022. Motalane says the notices given to the workers have several shortcomings. “The City notice has a number defects which includes a failure to call for representations and or objections before the decision to rescind was taken. It is our clients’ case that the notice is defective as the city seeks to make as if there is another process that can be followed to safeguard our clients’ rights and interests when a council resolution has effectively been issued,” says Motalane.
