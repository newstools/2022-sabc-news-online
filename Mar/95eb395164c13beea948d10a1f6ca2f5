No one claimed responsibility for the attack. Somalia is conducting parliamentary elections in an indirect process that involves clan elders picking the 275 members of the lower house, who then choose a new president on a date yet to be fixed. In a statement late on Wednesday, Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble said Wednesday’s killings were aimed at disrupting the elections. Data from the election commission shows that the election of 246 lawmakers has so far been completed, ahead of an April 15 deadline.
