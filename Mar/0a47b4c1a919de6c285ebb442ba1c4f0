An inquest docket has been opened following the death of a 15-year-old learner after allegedly being beaten by a teacher and a security guard last Tuesday in Tsakane, Ekurhuleni. Police don’t have sufficient evidence at this stage to open a murder docket – but say they are investigating. Nhlanhla Tshabalala succumbed to his injuries and was declared dead at Pholosong Hospital. The family says Tshabalala, was a learner at neighbouring Reshogofaditswe Secondary School, had gone to Tsakane Secondary School to collect his school bag and cell phone which were confiscated the previous day by the guards when he went to see his girlfriend. The Gauteng Education department is yet to comment on the matter. Family spokesperson, Mamokete Precious Mojalefa  says, “We have gone to the police, they said it’s going to be an inquest docket until they can gather evidence and maybe try to see if they can’t get other videos from the kids, so the case was opened.”
