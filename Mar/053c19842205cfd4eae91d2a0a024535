Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform, and Rural Development, Thoko Didiza says Sahpra has issued two permits for cannabis farming in the North West, for medicinal purposes. Didiza was one of the ministers responding to community concerns at the Presidential Imbizo in Mahikeng in the North West on Saturday. She says while they are also processing permits for the plantation of hemp, some farmers have raised some cost-related challenges. “They’ve raised certain issues with regards to the costs of the permits which we’ll be raising with Sahpra in our inter-ministerial meeting. We are also processing permits for those who want to plant hemp for industrial purposes. And I must say Mr. President that currently looking at regulatory mechanisms that will ensure that on one hand, we protect the industrial approach of hemp and cannabis but also be mindful of the challenges of drug abuse.” Didiza says they will also continue assisting farmers including subsistence farmers, in order to preserve food security. “We have already started issuing out vouchers to support those subsistence farmers who are planting back gardens and also the small sizes of a hector. We will continue to support farmers. Particularly those who are already commercialising to give them necessary instruments to do so.” President Cyril Ramaphosa leads the Presidential Imbizo in Mahikeng, North West: 12 March 2022
