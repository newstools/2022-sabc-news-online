The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will take place as scheduled on Sunday, despite a missile attack on an oil depot just miles from the race location. The depot in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, was attacked on Friday by Houthi rebels from Yemen, creating balls of fire and leaving race participants wondering about their safety. “Formula 1 and the FIA can confirm that following discussions with all the teams and drivers, the 2022 FIA Formula 1 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix will continue as scheduled,” Formula One posted to Twitter. “Following the widely reported incident that took place in Jeddah on Friday, there has been extensive discussion between all stakeholders, the Saudi government authorities and security agencies who have given full and detailed assurances that the event is secure.” The race will be run at the Jeddah Corniche Circuit. The dispute between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia dates to 2015, when the two sides clashed in a war in Yemen.
