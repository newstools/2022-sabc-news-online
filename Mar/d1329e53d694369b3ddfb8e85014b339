The KwaZulu-Natal Department of Health says it is concerned that the province continues to record over a hundred new COVID-19 infections per day over the past few days. Currently, the province’s over 6000 active cases are the highest in the country, followed by Gauteng with 4600 cases. Provincial Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane says she is also concerned that vaccination is moving at a disappointingly slow pace in townships and rural areas. “Our biggest worry really more than the active cases are the fact that we are not really going below 100 in terms of the daily infections going forward. The worry is that should we get to the winter season with that particular number still hovering around between 2 to 300 … fifth wave or bigger infections might come during the winter season,” says Simelane.

Simelane says they have now integrated vaccination into the mainstream health services at all 70 public hospitals and over 600 government clinics. “We have started to make sure that all our facilities actually have the capacity to vaccinate. Now when we say all our facilities, we are talking about all our hospitals and clinics in the province. So all of them are vaccinating. So as you see the number of community sites going down, it is as a result of the fact that we have integrated vaccinating into the mainstream within our province,” adds Simelane.
