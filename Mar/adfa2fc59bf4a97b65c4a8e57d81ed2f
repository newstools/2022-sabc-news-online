“The notorious N12 is pothole-riddled. That has not only become difficult to maneuver for all road users but also a cause of major losses for truckers,” truck driver Bonginkosi Ntshwaxu explains. “Here in Wolmaranstad, my load almost fell, just due to the potholes. Not because of bad driving or reckless driving. I’m driving 10 kilos an hour, but there are no roads.” Concerned residents say this major economic artery should never have been left to deteriorate this badly. “This road is pothole-riddled. It’s embarrassing because this is a national road. It’s really embarrassing.” “We are not even buying shocks for our cars anymore. Farmers tried to help fix the road, but the municipality refused.” Mbalula says the province took the decision to maintain the road which should have been taken care of by Sanral. “This is what corruption does to governance. This is a national road. It’s supposed to be fixed by Sanral. And then, the province then took the decision that they want this road, they want to maintain it. Now, money year after year is being rolled over. And this is what happened to the national roads from Matlosana upwards. It’s the only national road that looks like this.” Minister Mbalula has also committed to returning back in a month’s time to inspect the maintenance of the road.
