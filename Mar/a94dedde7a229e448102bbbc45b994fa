“It was not only injuries and there were problems with visas, it’s terrible. Every player had to go to the embassy himself so it was not easy the last two weeks because teams like Sundowns, Pirates and AmaZulu were playing in Africa somewhere. But I’m very happy now that those problems are solved and there will be some players who will come later so they will be there only on Wednesday in France but it’s okay, this is not really a problem. I’m happy that they will be there and that we can do what we expected to do in those two friendly games.” “Absolutely and said it already when I came here, I couldn’t understand that a country like South Africa was not always in Afcon. You can’t ask for South Africa to win the Afcon always or to be always in the final. No, but I think South Africa has to be every time in the Afcon, so we will try to do it for Ivory Coast and when we don’t succeed, that will be a little disaster.”
