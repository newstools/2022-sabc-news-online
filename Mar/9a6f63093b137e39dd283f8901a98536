Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Saturday, Moscow expects its operation in Ukraine to end with a signing of a comprehensive agreement on security issues, including Ukraine’s neutral status. “And, of course, the adjustment of laws to a civilised level in regards to the Russian language, Russian education, Russian media, and in regards to laws that foster the nazification of the country and the adoption of a law that prohibits this”, Lavrov added. Commenting on the relationship with China he said the cooperation between Russia and China will only become stronger in the current circumstances. 228 killed in Kyiv Kyiv city authorities on Saturday said 228 people had been killed in the capital since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began, including four children.
