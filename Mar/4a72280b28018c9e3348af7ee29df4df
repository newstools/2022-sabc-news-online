The Congress of the People (COPE) has called on the Minister of Basic Education, Angie Motshekga and the police to urgently investigate the alleged fraud by the management of Ilanga Secondary School in Witbank, in Mpumalanga. It is alleged the school has the tendency of effecting illegal deductions on stipends paid to 15 of its assistant educators. Those raising concerns about the suspicious deductions are threatened with dismissal and termination of their contracts. The deductions range between R1400 and R2000. The Mpumalanga Basic Education Department says it’s still investigating. COPE spokesperson, Dennis Bloom says this is disturbing. “And on top of that, when they question it, they’re threatened that they will be dismissed. If this is true then it’s a criminal offence and the law enforcement agencies must act. We call on the Minister of Basic Education to intervene and investigate this serious allegations,” says Bloom.
