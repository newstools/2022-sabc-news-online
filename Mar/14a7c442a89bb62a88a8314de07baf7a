Mamelodi Sundown’s will be playing at the FNB Stadium on Saturday when they face Al Ahly of Egypt in group stage action in the Confederations of African Football (CAF) Champions League. Their previous group match was at the Royal Bafokeng stadium. The venue is CAF approved and the players feel that the stadium could help them as they check in for country duty. Sundowns goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene, who has helped to earn the club three clean sheets in the group stages, believes it’s time to put petty PSL differences aside for this Champions League clash. “First game we also played away we played in Rustenburg and look there is nothing we can do. We have to go and play at FNB. At the end of the day, we are at home, we are used to playing at FNB. So, I think it’s about the country at the moment not about the PSL. I think we are ok with it and we are looking forward to Saturday.”
