Police in Mpumalanga have begun their investigation into the attack and robbery of world-renowned and award-winning Ndebele artist, Esther Mahlangu (87). Mahlangu was robbed of her personal firearm as well as an undisclosed amount of cash at her home at the weekend. She sustained facial injuries after the robber punched and strangled her until she lost consciousness. Mahlangu contacted the police after regaining consciousness. Mpumalanga Police spokesperson Brigadier Selvy Mohlala says, “It seems that the suspect was already inside the house when she was attacked, punched in a particular way and her hands were tied up. That is when the suspect ransacked the house.” “We have allocated that matter to the detectives to investigate because it happened on Saturday. We are investigating and following the leads, so we hope that we will arrest the suspect soon,” adds Mohlala. Mohlala gives more details:  Police say anyone with information about the crime is urged to call SAPS on 08600 10111.
