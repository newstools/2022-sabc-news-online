The leaders of the European Union (EU) countries decided to gradually reduce the purchase of natural gas from Russia from this year on at their spring summit on Friday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press conference after the summit that the decision will help the EU to gradually get rid of its reliance on Russia in energy. The EU leaders also agreed on a joint purchase of natural gas, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and hydrogen prior to next winter. To handle energy supply failure, the EU leaders decided to increase the natural gas reserve to 80 percent of the maximum volume ahead of next winter, possibly to 90 percent in the next few years. During the summit, the EU and the United States also issued a cooperation plan in the field energy, agreeing to expand the LNG export from the US to Europe. The plan will help the EU market to gain an extra of at least 15 billion cubic meters of LNG this year, and more in the future, as the EU estimated.
