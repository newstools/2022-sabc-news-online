The South African women’s cricket team has scored its fourth successive win in the ICC Women’s World Cup in New Zealand, beating their hosts by two wickets with three deliveries to spare in Hamilton. The White Ferns who elected to bat first were bowled out for 228 in the 48th over, despite an innings of 93 from captain Sophie Devine. Shabnim Ismael and Ayabonga Kahka took three wickets each. The Proteas were made to fight hard, but 67 from opening batter Laura Woolvaardt, and an unbeaten 34 from 35 deliveries from player-of-the-match, Marizanne Kapp, saw the Proteas home. It was South Africa’s first win over New Zealand in a World Cup match and they are still one of just two unbeaten sides in the tournament.
