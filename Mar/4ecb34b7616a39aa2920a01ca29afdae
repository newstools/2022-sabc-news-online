The South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) says it is still gathering preliminary information in connection with an incident in which a British Airways plane that was travelling from Gqeberha to Cape Town experienced a difficult landing. An investigation into the incident may be launched, based on the information gathered. The incident was reported on Saturday. No injuries or fatalities were reported. British Airways resumed their flight schedules on Thursday following a suspension by SACCA. SACAA grounded Comair’s planes indefinitely last week Sunday, citing that the airline had not adequately addressed safety issues in a move that also affected passengers of low-cost airline Kulula and British Airways. Flights resume after CAA lifts suspension of Comair’s operating certificate
