Metrorail in Cape Town says the recent vandalism of crucial infrastructure is aimed at crippling the service. Metrorail Spokesperson Nana Zenani says they have implemented additional security measures at various sub-stations following the theft and vandalism of Eskom cables. #RegionalService #ServiceAdvisory Vandalism at Eskom’s infrastructure has occurred once more. If the expected repair time falls within our operational schedule , it will have an impact on our service offerings. Commuters will be notified and kept abreast. — Metrorail W/Cape (@CapeTownTrains) March 10, 2022  Zenani says a cable that feeds electricity to the main sub-station has been deliberately cut twice this week. She says the train service has already been hard hit by the implementation of rolling blackouts, leaving many commuters stranded. “The type of vandalism that we see is not unique to the southern line. It is the type of vandalism that is aimed at crippling the service. We will be launching a joint investigation with Eskom, law enforcement and covert operations into the matter. We take such matters seriously and we want to deal with them decisively.”
