The national government has withdrawn Section 100 intervention in the North West. In 2018, the National Executive led by President Cyril Ramaphosa placed five provincial departments including the Office of the Premier under administration. The affected departments include Public Works and Roads, Community Safety and Transport, Health and Education. This was sparked by allegations of rampant corruption and lack of service delivery which led to violent protests. Chairperson of the NCOP Ad Hoc Committee on the Section 100 Intervention in the North West, China Dodovu says the withdrawal will be with effect from the 31st of this month. “The national government has decided to withdraw its intervention in the North West province effectively from the 31st of March 2022. This will be a phased-out approach wherein which firstly, all the departments like the department of the premier, public works, road and transport, health and education will migrate from section 139 1( b) to 1 (a). It means that all administrators who were placed in the said departments will be withdrawn.” Dodovu says the total withdrawal of the intervention will be executed after four months. “Directives will be used in terms of monitoring the performance of the affected departments. At the end of June or July, a report will serve before the committee and the house to ensure that total withdrawal is completed,” Dodovu explains.
