Three people died in a crash involving a truck and two sedans on the N4 toll road outside Mbombela in Mpumalanga on Wednesday night. The occupants of the sedans perished on the scene and the truck driver was not injured. Spokesperson for the Department of Community Safety, Security and Liaison, Moeti Mmusi, says a preliminary investigation suggests that one of the sedans was being towed when both vehicles lost control and veered in front of the truck, which was travelling in the same direction.
