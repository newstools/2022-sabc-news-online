Free State Finance MEC Gadija Brown says they are determined to reduce government debt for rates and taxes at various municipalities across the province. This comes after the Mangaung Metro cut water supply at various government premises in Bloemfontein over unpaid services. 80% of Free State municipalities are in a financially vulnerable position:  The Mangaung Metro is owed almost two billion rands by government departments and entities. Brown says they have entered into a payment plan in a bid to reduce the debt.
