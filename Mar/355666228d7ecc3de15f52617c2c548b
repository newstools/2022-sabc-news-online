Mbali Ntuli has announced her resignation from the Democratic Alliance (DA) and member of the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature. She says her decision is necessary for her growth as a community leader. Ntuli says she is proud of the work she has done in the DA. “I have tendered my resignation to my party, both as a DA member and as a member of the KZN legislature. I have decided of my own volition, that for my own personal growth and trajectory in the role that I play in the country to step back. I have done my bit for the DA and I can be proud of the work that I have done there. This is now an opportunity for me to do some more good work on the ground. So, I am not lost to serving my country but I think I am better suited and have more energies to do it elsewhere now.” In the tweet below, Ntuli announces her resignation: I have today resigned from the Democratic Alliance.
