The University of Venda is excited after it received funds from the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) to conduct antimicrobial resistance and global health research. Antimicrobials are medicines that prevent the multiplication of germs in the human body. This is a watershed moment for this growing previously disadvantaged institution. Head of HIV/AIDS and Global Research at the institution, Professor Pascal Bessong says the research is a milestone for them. “We put it forward to the SAMRC that we would have a unit that deals with antimicrobial and not just that but also in terms of global health issues. We are speaking about science and teaching that improves equity and access to health so we expect our data to inform policy to make drug use to treat infections with much efficiency,” says Pascal Bessong.
