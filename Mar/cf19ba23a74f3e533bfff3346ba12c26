The incoming Chief Justice Raymond Zondo has appealed to all magistrates and judges to take decisions, even if they make them unpopular in some instances. He says this will assist a great deal within the judiciary to further enjoy confidence from the South African public. Justice Zondo is set to take office from April 1st. He says it is upon those who preside over different cases not seek to gain popularity, when making judgments that are within the confines of the law. Justice Zondo spoke to the media in Midrand north of Johannesburg on Thursday. “It must never be the case that we want to make decisions that are going to make us popular. We must be prepared to make decisions that are unpopular and suffer whatever we may suffer. But those who appreciate the judiciary will appreciate that the kind of judges we have are those who belong to a constitutional dispensation such as the one we have.” Raymond Zondo’s briefing on his appointment as Chief Justice of South Africa:  Meanwhile, Zondo says the continued allegations that the country’s judiciary is captured need to be taken in a serious light and be investigated. He says the justice system is not in any way designed to have judges taking sides and sometimes being bribed to pass judgments in a favourable manner to a certain faction in a case. Recently among those who have come out strongly, saying the Judiciary is captured is Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema. But Zondo says if anyone feels or believes there is an element of capture in the judiciary, must come forth with the evidence, so that action can be taken against such judges.
