The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Limpopo says police stations have become soft targets for criminals. The party was reacting to a foiled robbery at the Jane Furse Police Station on Monday night during which a suspected robber was shot and killed. The suspected robber allegedly entered the station, disarmed a police officer and took his firearm. He was apparently shot by a police backup team. DA Spokesperson on Community Safety Katlego Suzan Phala says police stations in rural areas do not have resources and lack capacity. “This is not an isolated incident. Less than five months ago, 20 armed criminals robbed the Malamulele Police Station of firearms and ammunition and proceeded to rob local businesses of cash. DA reiterates our call; police stations are mostly under-resourced and incapacitated. Undertrained police officers and poor crime intelligence can not detect crime before it happens.” Gunshots a normal occurrence Meanwhile, community members living next to the Jane Furse Police Station have expressed shock at the foiled robbery. Some residents say the sound of gunshots is a normal occurrence as there are lots of taverns and robberies in the area. “I heard gunshots. It started on the side of the Chinese shop first but then moved closer to the police station. We are used to hearing these sounds when they rob the tavern and nearby businesses.” Limpopo police have since said the Independent Police Investigative Directorate is investigating the incident. Malamulele police station robbery In November last year, heavily-armed men stormed a local police station and took officers hostage in Malamulule. The group made off with 14 rifles, shotguns, and pistols, which they used to rob three businesses in the area. More details in the report below:  -Additional reporting by Mahlatse Phaladi
