An investigation into alleged procurement irregularities relating to the infamous Lesseyton stadium, near Komani, in the Eastern Cape is gaining momentum. Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkwebane led a team of investigators that conducted an inspection at the stadium. The facility was built at a cost of R15-million by the Enoch Mgijima municipality. When it was unveiled it sparked outrage as the cost did not seemingly match the facility. Public Protector’s spokesperson Oupa Segalwe says the inspection is part of a lengthy investigation that is still to be conducted. “We are looking at whether anyone was enriched improperly whether there were irregularities in the bidding processes or the tendering processes because ideally when you have this kind of thing you have to put up a tender and open it for all those who would have the necessary skills to do the jobs.” Residents of Ndlovukazi Village where the facility is built say the stadium was not on their list of priorities. They say they want those responsible to account. “I would be happy if those responsible for this mess are arrested because so much money was wasted here, they must be arrested. This stadium is not a priority they are supposed to do roads because our roads are very bad, we have no water. We find water in the dam and the cows use that dam for water… This stadium doesn’t even cost one million.”
