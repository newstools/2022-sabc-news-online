Bilateral relations between South Africa and Mozambique will be enhanced on Friday when President Cyril Ramaphosa hosts his Mozambican counterpart President Filipe Nyusi in Pretoria. The leaders will attend the third session of the bi-national commission between the two nations. The meeting has been preceded by foreign affairs ministers who met on Thursday. South Africa and Mozambique share strong historical ties arising from the solidarity formed during the two nations struggles against colonialism and Apartheid. International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor says fighting terrorism in Cabo Delgado remains one of the central priorities within the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The Bi-national commission is made up of a number areas such as defence, economic development, political and diplomatic structure. Meanwhile, Pretoria and Maputo recently abstained at the United Nations General Assembly in the resolution to reprimand Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
