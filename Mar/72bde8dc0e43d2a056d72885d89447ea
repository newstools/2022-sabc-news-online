Zululand District Municipality Mayor Thulasizwe Zulu says he hopes that AmaZulu King-elect Misuzulu ka Zwelithini will follow in the footsteps of his father, the late King Goodwill Zwelithini. Zulu has remembered the late King as a unifier who strived for peace. He was speaking at the memorial prayer service for the late King and his wife, the Regent Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu, at KwaKhangelamankengane Royal Palace in Nongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal. “As the people of Zululand, we are here to honour our late King…King Zwelithini kaBhekuZulu who was a unifier, a custodian of our heritage and who was a promoter of social cohesion. The late King loved peace, he loved development, he loved reconciliation and we hope that our King Misuzulu will carry on the legacy of his father in taking the Zulu nation forward.” Meanwhile, the brother of the late AmaZulu King, Prince Mbonisi Zulu, has questioned whether King-elect MisuZulu kaZwelithini was nominated by the Zulu Royal family as the successor. He was speaking on the sidelines of a prayer service. Prince Mbonisi Zulu says that the family is yet to decide who will ascend the throne. “Because people have been misled, we take the King’s children the same level, until such time we come together and then we can come up with the name of that King-elect to take the throne. At the moment you can’t hail to somebody, even the throne has not been cleansed. I am saying I am taking him like one of the Kings’ sons or the princes and princesses, so there is no difference. As I am saying to you we need to sit down and come up with a right decision about the one who will take the throne.” The late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini’S Memorial Prayer Service:  Additional reporting by Vusi Makhosini.
