Mamelodi Sundowns will advance to the quarterfinals of the CAF Champions League top of group A. The Brazilians who are yet to lose in the group stages of the competition beat Sudanese side Al Hilal 4-2 in Omdurman Sudan. With the win, Sundowns sit comfortably at the top of the log with 12 points with just one match remaining. Sundowns who had already qualified for the quarterfinals were playing for prestige to ensure they finish top of the group into the last eight. They had to ensure that they secure maximum points against Al Hilal. The Sudanese team was expected to be a tough opponent as they were aiming to catch up with Egyptian giants Al Ahly who are second in group A. Sundowns’ intentions were clear as early as the second minute when Peter Shalulile broke the deadlock. From a patient build-up, the Namibian put his side ahead with a tame shot. The South African were dealt a blow in the 11th minute when Brian Onyango was red-carded for foul play. Despite playing with ten men, the visitors went into the break leading two-nil. Teboho Mokoena extended the lead from a free-kick to ease the pressure of being a man down. Yasir El Tayeb reduced the deficit 10 minutes into the second half when the Sundown’s defenders failed to close the attacker down. But their hope of a comeback immediately faded when Thapelo Morena scored the third for the Chloorkop side. He completed his brace in the 89th minute to seal victory, while substitute Osman Eltayib netted a consolation goal for the home side. In the Dstv Premiership, TS Galaxy and Supersport United shared the spoils. It ended one-all at the Mbombela Stadium. Orebotse Mongae opened the scoring for Galaxy in the 13th minute from a Keenan Phillips error when attempting a back pass to his goalkeeper. But the joy was short-lived when Jamie Webber equalised 12 minutes later from the penalty spot after Mongae had brought down Iqraam Rayners inside the 18-yard box.
