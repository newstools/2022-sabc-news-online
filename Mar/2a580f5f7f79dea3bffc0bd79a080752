Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Khumbudzo Ntshaveni has decided to withdraw all the SABC’s quarterly performance reports submitted under her signature. In a letter to the public broadcaster, the Minister says she has written to Parliament to withdraw reports from the 2020 financial year as they are based on inaccurate information. The move comes after the SABC said on Friday that it was losing revenue due to digital migration. The Minister says it contradicts information presented in the SABC quarterly performance and Turn Around Plan Implementation reports. Ntshaveni says she will notify the Auditor-General of South Africa of her withdrawal of support as well as the Minister of Finance of her intention to withhold the release of the next tranches of financial assistance for the public broadcaster’s Turnaround Strategy.
