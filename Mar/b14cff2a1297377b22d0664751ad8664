Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande says R200 million has been allocated to Community Education and Training Colleges in South Africa this year for skills development programmes. The funding will be split among the nine Community Education and Training Colleges (CETG), with one being located in each province. Nzimande was speaking at the Ministerial Summit on Community Education and Training which is being held at the Cape Town International Convention Centre this week. “There are a lot of skills that are needed. Self-taught people, the famous bush mechanic in the township, should be able to go to Community and Education Training Centre and say I want to improve my skills so that I can be a better motor mechanic. So this R200 million then is going to allow this kind of diversification of the offerings by Community Education and Training sector to also offer skills beyond just improving your formal education,” says Nzimande. We are continuing to reinforce our commitment to ensuring access to higher education for all, specifically students from disadvantaged backgrounds. pic.twitter.com/y2C4jiblFa — Minister Blade Nzimande (@DrBladeNzimande) February 7, 2022  Minister @DrBladeNzimande will this morning deliver a keynote address at the inaugural Community Education and Training (CET) Summit this morning at Cape Town International Convention Centre taking place from today and tomorrow #CETSummit pic.twitter.com/bZh4ZW1R4s — HigherEduTrainingZA (@HigherEduGovZA) March 8, 2022
