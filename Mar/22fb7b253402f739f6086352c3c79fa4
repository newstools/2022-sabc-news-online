Today marks a year since the passing of the late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini. The longest reigning Zulu Monarch died at the age of 72 from COVID-19-related complications at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli Hospital in Durban. It is believed that two separate memorial prayers are being held at palaces in Nongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. The late AmaZulu King Goodwill Zwelithini’s memorial prayer service:  “The first memorial service organised by the late King’s wives is being held at KwaKhethomthandayo Royal palace. It is expected to be attended by some members of the royal family including the late King’s brother, Prince Mbonisi. A second memorial service at the KwaKhangelamankengane Royal palace is expected to be attended by King-elect Misizulu kaZwelithini and traditional Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi. Since the death of King Zwelithini, the AmaZulu Royal family has been embroiled in dispute after dispute, uch to the displeasure of some family members. There was drama and chaos on the night Prince Misuzulu was named heir to the throne and he had to be whisked away to safety. As the rift amongst the royals grew, the King’s first wife Queen Sibongile Dlamini-Zulu and her two daughters decided to approach the court. She wanted the court to assert her the right to 50% of the late King’s estate, while Princess Ntandoyenkosi Zulu and Ntombizosuthu Zulu-Duma challenged the validity of the signature on the King’s will. The late King’s brother, Prince Mbonisi also entered the fray, filing papers to prevent a secret coronation planned to install Misuzulu. The Queen and Prince Mbonisi’s applications were dismissed with cost. The court also ruled that King-Elect Misuzulu was the undisputed heir to the throne.
