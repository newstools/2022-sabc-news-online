The attempted murder trial of Mackenzie Ratselane is continuing in the Bloemfontein Regional Court on Friday morning. Ratselane is accused of stabbing his ex-wife, and Lesedi FM Current Affairs presenter, Dimakatso Folotsi, multiple times, in February last year. He faces charges of attempted murder, kidnapping, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of an unlicensed firearm and ammunition. The defence is expected to continue with the cross examination of Folotsi. Last month, the Free State NPA Spokesperson, Phaladi Shuping said, “The NPA has been ready since May, but unfortunately, the defense has requested several postponements, which is why the matter has not yet been finalised, or we have not started with the trial. The trial is set for three days and we hope that tomorrow when we start with the trial, there won’t be any request for postponement and all the parties will proceed with the matter because we want to see the matter being finalised as soon as possible.” Gender-based violence | Organisations protest attack on Lesedi FM anchor Dimakatso Ratselane:
