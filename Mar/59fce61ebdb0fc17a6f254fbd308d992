Newly elected African National Congress Youth League (ANCYL) regional leaders in Mopani, Limpopo, have described the regional elective conference as a success. The ANC Youth League was being led by a task team after all their structures were disbanded in 2018. All the top five positions in the region were uncontested in a conference held in Phalaborwa. The conference has ended. The newly elected regional secretary, Thabang Mukhawane, is excited that the youth league is getting active again. “We had a fruitful conference,very progressive one without any form of disruption, without any objection and we further elected the  leadership Joe Ramatsi as the chairperson of the region, we elected comrade Renny Mabuza as the deputy chairperson of the region and myself comrade Thabang Mukhwawane as the regional secretary the entire officials elected unopposed,” says Mukhawane. The ANC Youth League conference may be postponed for two months:  The ANC Task Team in Limpopo was set up in August last year to ensure unity amongst the members. This was after the party failed to elect new leaders after the term of office of the previous leadership lapsed.
