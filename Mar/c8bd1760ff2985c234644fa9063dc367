The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it welcomes the High Court in Pretoria’s preservation order for the Gupta-owned Optimum Coal Mine (OCM) in Mpumalanga. The Court ordered that the mine be preserved with a curator appointed to work with the business rescue practitioners, who have been in charge since February 2018. NPA Spokesperson, Sindisiwe Seboka says the Court has confirmed a draft order which the NPA had been seeking. “So what we’re basically doing with this particular application, that we brought to court and successfully able to preserve, is that we are showing that the money that was used to basically purchased this Optimum Coal Mine, and well, as the terminal were used and funnelled through state owned entities such as Transnet, Eskom and various other money laundering schemes. So what this means is that once this has been preserved, which was done today, the next step would be for us to basically apply for forfeiture application and eventually get this forfeited to the state,” says
