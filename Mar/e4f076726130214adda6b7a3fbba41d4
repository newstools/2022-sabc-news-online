KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has pledged his support to the AmaZulu King Misuzulu kaZwelithini after President Cyril Ramaphosa recognised him as the new AmaZulu monarch. MisuZulu’s father, King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu passed on a year ago. Zikalala says they will be working together with the royal household and national government to ensure that the coronation ceremony takes place according to plan. “As the provincial government we further wish to congratulate his majesty King Misuzulu and pledge our support and that we are from now onward going to work with the royal house toward ensuring that the coronation ceremony takes place according to the plans. We will be working with national government as well as the Royal house in ensuring that this is done according to the plans and as soon as possible.” The recognition of Prince Misuzulu KaZwelithini as leader of AmaZulu : Buthelezi  Earlier, Prince Mbonisi Zulu announced that he does not accept the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to recognise King Misuzulu kaZwelithini as the new monarch. The message was conveyed through Prince Mbonisi Zulu’s lawyer Peter Zwane. The lawyer said his client welcomes the announcement by the President but they will consult on any further steps. Prince Mbonisi brought an interdict to stop a supposed coronation for King Misuzulu kaZwelithini in December last year. Prince Mbonisi Zulu is the brother of the late AmaZulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuZulu. Zwane says Prince Mbonisi’s argument is that the process that was followed by the Royal family to nominate Misuzulu kaZwelithini to be the next King was not totally correct.
