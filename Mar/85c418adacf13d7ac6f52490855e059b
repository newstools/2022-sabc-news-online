Themba Godi has been re-elected African People’s Convention (APC) president to lead the party for the third time since its formation in 2007. Enerst Hlathi and Mandla Mokoena have also retained their positions as deputy president and Treasurer-General respectively. The APC is currently holding its elective congress in Giyani, Limpopo. The party was formed by Themba Godi after leaving his position as Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania deputy president through floor-crossing. Godi left the PAC with a provincial representative from the Eastern Cape, Zingisa Nkhabile and Malesela Ledwaba from Gauteng. The party retained its seat in parliament in the 2014 national election but lost it in the 2019 election. Former Eastern Cape provincial leader, Sonwabile Ngonini has been elected new Chairperson of the party. The conference will be concluded on Monday.
