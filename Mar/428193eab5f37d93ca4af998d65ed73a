ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe says they welcome the easing of some of these stringent measures that government previously imposed even under Alert Level 1 allowing gatherings to now take place albeit with limited numbers and where people can prove that there is some proof of vaccination or negative COVID testing. Earlier today, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced a further easing of coronavirus restrictions during Level 1 of the lockdown – including that masks no longer need to be worn outdoors.
