African National Congress (ANC) president Cyril Ramaphosa says he is convinced that the ANC in Mpumalanga is ready to hold its provincial conference. He has described as a success, the meeting he had with the party leadership on Monday. Ramaphosa had come to try and quell tensions in the provincial structure, ahead of the party’s provincial elective conference this month. It was meant to take place this coming weekend, but has been postponed to the 18th of March. Ramaphosa says he’s confident that the ANC will be united across the country, and will have a substantial amount of renewal ahead of the 55th national elective conference in December. However, in Mpumalanga there has been a number of disputes by the different branches, with some meetings descending into chaos in the province. But Ramaphosa says this will soon be a thing of the past. “They seem very ready and keen to go to conference, which we are grateful for because they have done all the preparatory work, at branch level which is good and they do qualify to go to conference. And I raised with them the issue of unity because there has been quite a bit of disunity in the the province and I stressed the benefits of unity. And to choose a leadership that will unify the province,” he says. ANC President, Cyril Ramaphosa addressing media in Mpumalanga
