Students at the University of Zululand in northern KwaZulu-Natal have voiced concerns over safety at off-campus residences. The University’s Students’ Representative Council (SRC) Secretary-General Ndumiso Mahlase alleges that a student was killed during an incident last week, prompting students to embark on a demonstration to appeal for help. Mahlase is calling on the university to take over more residences, saying that some properties owned by private landlords have raised concerns. “The incidences where students are subjected to this harm and violence arises from those particular residences which are not under university supervision. The university must accredit more residences under its name as part of a long-term solution that must be implemented,” says Mahlase. The University of Zululand was not immediately available for comment. In September 2019 students at the University of Zululand marched over safety concerns
