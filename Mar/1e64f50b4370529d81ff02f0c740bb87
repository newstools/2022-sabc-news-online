According to the NICD, “The majority of new cases today are from Gauteng (39%), followed by Western Cape (28%). KwaZulu Natal accounted for 18%; Mpumalanga and North West each accounted for 4% respectively. Eastern Cape and Free State each accounted for 2% respectively, and Limpopo and Northern Cape each accounted for 1% respectively.” Face masks Last week, the Health Department’s Director-General Dr Sandile Buthelezi said the latest draft regulations on COVID-19 proposes that it will no longer be compulsory to wear face masks outdoors. The Department published the proposed regulations under the National Health Act – focussing on the wearing of masks, vaccinations and travel among other COVID-19-related topics. The public comment period for the new regulations will close on April 15. Dr Buthelezi said the proposal suggests masks will be compulsory for indoor gatherings. “I know there has been a lot of media hype around face masks as other countries have removed them. But we still believe that inside we still need to push for masking. But when someone is outside, we want to avoid people wearing masks. There is enough evidence now that it is not a useful intervention.”
