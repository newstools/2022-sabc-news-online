The Water Research Commission says part of the water scarcity problem in South Africa is due to a lack of skilled personnel to manage resources in the country. The commission made the comments as the country wrapped up Water Week. Government says that it will focus on groundwater as a source for the country. South Africa, like other places in the world, has seen the effects of climate change on water supply. The commission’s Dr Shafick Adams says 13% of South Africa’s current water supply comes from groundwater. “Of the hundred and so municipalities that rely predominantly on groundwater, I can’t even count on one of my hands how many of them employ skilled personnel to manage those systems. So, it’s a good indication of where some of our issues are.” South Africa observed National Water Week with the focus being on groundwater sources.
