The Walter Sisulu University (WSU) says there are only three outstanding issues of the 26 tabled by students, currently receiving attention. Students at the university took to the streets to protest about the outstanding issues. University Spokesperson, Yonela Tukwayo says the students want a social space to consume alcoholic drinks on campus, they also want the university to increase the quota of students admitted under special cases and are demanding an increase in their book allowance that they receive from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NFSAS). “On this last note, it is difficult for us as a university to change what has already been put in place by NFSAS. We are merely implementing the rules because none of those laptops were free and all the NFSAS funded students were supposed to have their accounts deducted and as the university we do it over two years so they don’t pay the lump sum for the laptops all at once,” says Tukwayo. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesting students who blocked the N2 going past the campus. SASCO PEC member, Emihle Goniwe, says they’ve engaged the university management several times but nothing has been done. “Amongst the 25 demands which were submitted to the university management, I can just mention a few, which is accommodation for post-graduate students, the issue of NSFAS allowances, the issue of students who are unable to register until to date even though there was an allocation from the office of the premier in the Eastern Cape. There were endeavours which the students on the ground advised had advised that they must be drawn to make sure that all students are funded,” says Goniwe.
