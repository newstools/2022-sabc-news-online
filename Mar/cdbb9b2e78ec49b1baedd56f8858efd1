Government is stepping up efforts to lure investors to the country. After concluding what he described as a resounding successful SA Investment Conference last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa is now in the United Arab Emirates to make a case for investors in the Gulf region and beyond to bring their money to South Africa. The President is leading a high-powered business delegation to the Dubai Expo. President Ramaphosa says his ambitious investment drive is beginning to bear fruit and buoyed by the success of the Fourth South Africa Investment which raised over R330 billion last week, President Ramaphosa is again on a mission to lure more investors into the country. President Ramaphosa optimistic about possible outcomes at the EXPO 2020 Dubai:  He is today in Dubai to showcase not just the country’s agricultural and tourism offerings, but also what South Africa offers in manufacturing, defence, aerospace, and e-mobility among others. He said as the commitments made turn into projects, this will lead to the creation of jobs, end poverty and improve the quality of life of all South Africans.
