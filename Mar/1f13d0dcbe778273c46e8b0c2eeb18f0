Residents of Nongoma in northern KwaZulu-Natal have appealed for unity in the AmaZulu Royal family amidst ongoing divisions over the successor to the throne. The dispute over the rightful heir has continued to play itself out in public. Last week, President Cyril Ramaphosa recognised King MisuZulu KaZwelithini as successor to his father the late King Goodwill Zwelethini. But the decision was rejected by some members of the Royal Family, including Prince Mbonisi Zulu, a brother of late the late King. The faction is currently meeting behind closed doors at the Khethomthandayo palace. Nongoma residents are calling for peace and unity. “To all of us including the regiments and the entire Zulu nation including the entire Zulu Royals, we appeal for peace to us the divisions should be over by now since the President has recognised our King. Let us all accept that let’s respect him and the throne so that other nations will respect us. After everything that is going on, especially when it comes to the conflict between the Royal Princes and Princesses at the end of the day, there must be a reunion, the Princesses, iSilo Samabandla, and the Princes must come together and build up the Royal household together.” Some members of AmaZulu Royal family set to meet in KwaNongoma: Update
