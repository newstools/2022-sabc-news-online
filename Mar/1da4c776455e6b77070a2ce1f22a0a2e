Operation Dudula leader Nhlanhla ‘Lux’ Dlamini is expected to appear in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court, west of Johannesburg, on Monday after his case was postponed on Friday. He’s spending the weekend behind bars. The case against Dlamini and Operation Dudula members was opened by Soweto resident Victor Ramerafe with the support of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members, regarding the alleged ransacking of Ramerafe’s house. Dudula had alleged that Ramerafe’s property was a drug den.

Kopanang Africa Against Xenophobia organizer, Dr Trevor Ngwane, says Operation Dudula upholds lawlessness and will not last long. “This thing of xenophobia is diverting our attention from matters of importance in South Africa politically. Operation Dudula, after a few months, this movement will fizzle away because it’s got no political vision, it’s got no political future, it’s just a lot of opportunism which will dissipate and go away,” says Ngwane.
