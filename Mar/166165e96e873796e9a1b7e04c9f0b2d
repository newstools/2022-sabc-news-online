A case against 15 men accused in the Marikana killings of 2012 will resume at the North West High court sitting at Mogwase later on Monday. Some of the 15 men are charged with the murder of ten people at Marikana during a violent strike at Lonmin in August 2012. They are to appear on Monday following the application filed with the North Gauteng High Court for charges against them to be withdrawn. Anele Zonke and 14 others are facing charges ranging from murder, robbery, malicious damage to property and the unlawful possession of firearms. The charges relate to the murder of 10 people, proceeding 16 August 2012, the day on which 34 mineworkers were killed by the police during a strike at Lonmin Platinum Mine operations at Marikana. The State alleges that the accused killed two policemen, two Lonmin security officers, and six non-striking workers. Lawyers representing the men have since filed an application with the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria, for charges against their clients to be either dropped or reviewed.
