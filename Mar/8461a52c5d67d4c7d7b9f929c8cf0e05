Many foreign-owned shops have remained closed in Durban despite the failure of Operation Dudula to launch its operations in KwaZulu-Natal on Saturday. Dudula organisers failed to get permission to stage the event at Gugu Dlamini Park. Operation Dudula supporters have been protesting against illegal immigrants and drug dens in Gauteng over the past weeks. Police remained on high alert in Durban following the news of the much-awaited launch. KwaZulu-Natal coordinator of Operation Dudula, Mfanafuthi Dumakude, says they were forced to postpone their launch after police said they couldn’t deal with them due to a lack of capacity. Dumakude says, “We are against the dealing of drugs, especially by the illegal immigrants that is  being conducted all over South Africa.” “We are seeing it, young people of South Africa are now addicted to drugs, some of them are being forced to turn into prostitutes they are being fed with drugs and then from thereafter they are being turned into prostitutes. We do not agree with that particular conduct of the foreigners.” Dobsonville Meanwhile, last week, there is chaos outside the Dobsonville police station as Members of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) gathered to assist an elderly man who claims to have been assaulted by the members of Operation Dudula. The group has been protesting against illegal immigrants and drug dens in the areas over the past few weeks. EFF members carrying golf clubs and pangas are demonstrating, while metres away members of Operation Dudula have also gathered in response.
