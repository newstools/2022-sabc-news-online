The eThekwini Metro says it’s in the process of procuring satellite leak detection technology to assist in detecting water leaks in the city. Satellite imaging technology is apparently a cost-effective way of locating water leaks across water networks. Last month, the municipality’s audit committee pointed out that water losses and aging infrastructure posed a serious challenge to the municipality. The city was estimated to be losing half of the water it was buying from Umgeni Water. Municipal spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela says the technology will help provide solutions to the current water challenges facing Durban and surrounding areas. “Our City is at an advanced stage to procure a technology that is going to assist us in detecting water leaks via Satellite. We could be the first city in the country to have this technology and we’re very excited about it in light of the water that we are losing as a result of leaks that are exacerbated by the illegal connections,” Mayisela elaborates.
