Three South Africans, competing at the WGC Dell Technologies match play event in Austin, Texas, are all still looking for their first wins after two days of play. Louis Oosthuizen, Christiaan Bezuidenhout and Erik van Rooyen are all out of contention in the match play tournament. Meanwhile, another South African, Wilco Nienaber is tied for second on the leaderboard after the second round of the Qatar Masters in Doha. Nienaber shot a flawless 4 under par 68, for back-to-back 68’s to move to 8 under par. The 21-year-old was cool as you like as he drained four birdies in his round. Nienaber, who is looking for his first win on the DP World Tour, is tied for second alongside Adrian Meronk of Poland and Chase Hanna of the USA. The trio trail Spain’s Pablo Larrazabal by one stroke. Larrazabal, who won his sixth tournament on tour earlier this month at Pecanwood in the North West, shot a 1 under par 71 to move to 9 under par. It was not quite the sublime 64 he shot in round one. He mixed three bogeys and a double-bogey with an eagle and four birdies to sneak ahead on the leaderboard.
