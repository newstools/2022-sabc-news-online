Australians remembered late cricket icon Shane Warne in a televised memorial service at his home stadium, the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Wednesday, with nearly 50 000 people attending. The memorial started with those gathered calling out “Warney, Warney,” as cricketer Donald Bradman’s granddaughter and soprano Greta Bradman sang the Australian national anthem. Warne’s father and children made heartfelt tributes, as other cricketing legends remembered Warne as a “genius, entertainer and king”. Warne’s daughter Summer had this to say, “I never thought one’s voice could bring such comfort until I can no longer hear it. I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that you won’t be able to walk down the aisle on my special day and be by my side. You’re not going to meet your grandchildren you’re going to have one day but instead, you’re going to be someone that I tell my kids about and how much of an amazing father you were to me and will always be in my heart. How good of a grandpa you would have made and how they would have loved and adored you just like I do. You lived 100 lives Dad, you never took anything for granted and you made sure that you lived every day to the absolute fullest.” Many were seated in the southern grandstand, which was renamed the ˜Shane Warne Stand”, unveiled by his three children, in the wake of his death at age 52.
