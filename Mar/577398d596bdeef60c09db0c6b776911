The South African Football Association (SAFA) will elect its new president and national executive committee by the 30th of August this year. This was one of the resolutions taken in today’s marathon 30th ordinary congress of SAFA held in Johannesburg. The congress was attended by the executive committee and all 52 regions of SAFA. The Association has again reported a profit for a second successive year despite the COVID-19 disruptions that ravaged all sporting codes in the country. The organisation has agreed to suspend the SAFA Tshwane president pending disciplinary action. Solly Mohlabeng who is one of the candidates to contest against the current president was removed from the meeting after allegedly causing disruptions to the proceedings.
