Patriotic Alliance (PA) Deputy President Kenny Kunene has called for the immediate release of Nhlanhla ‘Lux’ Dlamini. He was arrested on Thursday after a criminal case was opened against him. Dlamini has led numerous campaigns by the movement Operation Dudula targetting alleged illegal immigrants in parts of Johannesburg. The legal representatives for Dlamini have expressed concern about encountering difficulties in their bid to get bail for him. Operation Dudula members say Nhlanhla Dlamini’s arrest politically motivated Supporters of the movement have protested outside the Johannesburg Central Police station demanding Dlamini’s release. Kunene says Dlamini’s arrest is politically motivated as there was no charge against him. “By yesterday they didn’t even know what to charge him with: housebreaking, intimidation, assault – they ended up saying it’s housebreaking and damage to property. So we’re aware that there’s a political motive to it. But also when Malema is to be arrested or many other politicians whether in the ANC they are called by the police and told that they must hand themselves in. Why is Nhlanhla Lux an exception? Why couldn’t he be called, why couldn’t they send a message to him? The law dictates that he can get bail,” says Kunene. Kunene spoke to the SABC about Nhlahla’s arrest:  Operation Dudula leader Nhlahla ‘Lux’ Dlamini remains behind bars
