Prince Mbonisi Zulu has announced that he does not accept the decision by President Cyril Ramaphosa to recognise King Misuzulu kaZwelithini as the new monarch. The message was conveyed through Prince Mbonisi Zulu’s lawyer Peter Zwane. The lawyer said his client welcomes the announcement by the President but they will consult on any further steps. Prince Mbonisi brought an interdict to stop a supposed coronation for King Misuzulu kaZwelithini in December last year. Prince Mbonisi Zulu is the brother of the late AmaZulu King, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuZulu. Zwane says Prince Mbonisi’s argument is that the process that was followed by the Royal family to nominate Misuzulu kaZwelithini to be the next King was not totally correct. He says the process is being faced with legal challenges and the court did not make pronouncements. “To a certain degree, Prince MisuZulu and Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi accepted that not everything that was supposed to be done in terms of the law has been followed, to come to a point where Prince MisuZulu is correctly nominated by the family as it required by the act.” For full interview with the lawyer below:  He noted that there’s a list of requirements that need to be met for one to be correctly and legally nominated by the Royal family.
