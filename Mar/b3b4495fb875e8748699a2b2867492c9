According to preliminary data, the S&P 500 lost 31.85 points, or 0.76%, to end at 4,172.46 points, while the Nasdaq Composite lost 265.87 points, or 2.07%, to 12,577.94. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 4.68 points, or 0.01%, to 32,939.51. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks was also down sharply, while the Cboe volatility index,also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, rose. The S&P financial index was higher as US Treasury yields jumped to 2-1/2-year highs.
