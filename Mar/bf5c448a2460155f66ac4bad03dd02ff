A giant puppet walk, to raise awareness about endangered aquatic life in rivers, ponds and dams, is this weekend being held at Boschendal outside Cape Town. This is one of the highlights during the farm’s annual month-long plum harvest festival. The procession also aims to focus on water sustainability. The organisers say the puppet walk boasts three enormous colourful puppets, one of which is a representation of the highly endangered indigenous redfin minnow fish. The parade, with artists from Barrydale and the creations by the Ukwanda puppet company, will kick off at 11am on Sunday and ends with a performance in front of the historic Boschendal Manor House.
