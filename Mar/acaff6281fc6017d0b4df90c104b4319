Outstanding pre-trial matters in the corruption case against former eThekwini mayor, Zandile Gumede and her 21 co-accused will be addressed by the State and defence teams behind closed doors. Gumede and her co-accused appeared in the Durban High Court earlier today where some legal representatives were making requests for further particulars about the charges. The 22 accused are charged with 2 786 counts of fraud, corruption and racketeering. Gumede in court on charges of fraud and corruption:  It stems from an alleged irregular Solid Waste tender for Durban in 2017 that cost in excess of R400 million. KwaZulu-Natal NPA spokesperson Natasha Ramkisson-Kara says: “The matter of  Zandile Gumede and the 21 others returned to the Durban High Court today. The matter was previously postponed for the State to respond to requests for further particulars from some of the defense counsel. This request was acceded to timeously and prior to today’s appearance. However, in court today, counsel advised that they will be making additional requests for further particulars to the State. The matter was adjourned in the interim, the responses to the requests for further particulars as well as the pre-trial process will be dealt with by the State and the parties involved.” In a statement, KwaZulu-Natal NPA says the state confirmed its readiness for trial, however, some of the legal representatives advised that they would be making additional requests for further particulars.
