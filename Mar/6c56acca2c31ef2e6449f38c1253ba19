Large parts of Johannesburg have been affected by power outages as Eskom implements stage four blackouts. Roosevelt Park, Northcliff, Mayfair, Killarney, Houghton, Newlands, Midrand, and Westdene are just some of the areas experiencing power failures. While in Tshwane, large parts of Pretoria East have been affected due to the implementation of blackouts. The City of Tshwane says its power infrastructure is not designed to cope with the repeated switching on and off of units. Spokesperson Sipho Stuurman says, “Our electricity infrastructure was not designed to be switched on and off repeatedly. Some of our major challenges are the tripping and damage to our electricity grid. The situation has been made worse by the wet weather making electrical work difficult at this particular time. However, our teams are on the ground working to restore power outages caused by load shedding as fast as possible.” Eskom Eskom says stage four rolling blackouts will continue until Friday morning. The power utility says due to further failures of generation units it had no choice but to resort to this. It says it’s finding itself in a serious predicament as it aims to balance its limited resources, including a shortage of diesel, while South Africans battle stage four rolling blackouts. #POWERALERT1 Due to further failures of generation units, Stage 4 loadshedding will be implemented from 09:00 today until 05:00 on Friday in order to manage the emergency reserves pic.twitter.com/OMmqjLKIUX — Eskom Hld SOC Ltd (@Eskom_SA) March 9, 2022  Production The CEO of the SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Alan Mukoki says blackouts affect the economy as businesses and production have to shut down.
