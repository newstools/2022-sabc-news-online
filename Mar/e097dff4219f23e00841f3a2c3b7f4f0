The family of the late ANC Member of Parliament, Mxolisi Sokatsha, says they are devastated and shattered by his passing. Sokatsha lost his life in a car crash on Friday night on the N12 road, 20 Kilometres outside Belmont. He and a female passenger from the second car involved in the crash died at the scene. The late MP served as a MEC at four Northern Cape departments before moving to Parliament in 2019. The family’s spokesperson, Eric Jantjies, says Sokatsha was their anchor and his passing is a big loss for his wife, children and the entire family. “We are very much devastated as the family. We are very saddened. It is a big loss really. Everyone is shattered with his sudden passing. As a family, we are trying. One will never get used to death. We are trying to cope as a family but I must say that we are not well at all as I am saying he was everything to the family. So, everyone is just shocked and devastated.”
