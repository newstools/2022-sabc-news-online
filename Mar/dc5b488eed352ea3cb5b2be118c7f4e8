Frustrated residents of Hammanskraal are calling on all government spheres to open a clinic whose construction started in 2017 and was completed in 2019. Government spent over R100-million to construct the project. At the time, Mandisa Shiceka Clinic was provided with temporary tents and mobile rooms to offer medical treatment to the community. Hammanskraal stakeholders decided during a meeting with Gauteng Health MEC, Nomathemba Mokgethi, at the clinic in Mandela village to resolve the long-standing issue. They also say Gauteng Premier David Makhura previously visited the facility, during which he promised to have it officially opened. But they say to date, nothing has happened. They have threatened to take action if they don’t get positive answers within seven days. “We are so hurt, because they built this big clinic for us, of which we were supposed to use it from the previous years, but it’s still standing like this, says one resident.” Another resident says: “Now we have to go to the neighbouring areas to get basic primary health care…” Meanwhile, Gauteng Health MEC has criticised the DA-led administration in power for failing to provide municipal services such as water and sewer connections, so that the clinic could open.
