Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema has again thrown his party’s support firmly behind Russia in the ongoing conflict between that country and the Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine more than three weeks ago. At least ten million people in Ukraine have fled their homes as Russia bombards major Ukrainian cities. Speaking on Human Rights Day at the commemoration of the Sharpville Massacre, Malema said that Russia had given support during the liberation struggle against the apartheid regime – providing arms, money and education, “Russia equipped us with weapons and gave us money to fight apartheid” CIC @Julius_S_Malema together with the leadership of the EFF remembering the lives of those we lost on this day in 1960. We honour of those who were slain by the Apartheid government for refusing to have their movement controlled and dictated to them in their own land. pic.twitter.com/STBZ8HqzBb — Economic Freedom Fighters (@EFFSouthAfrica) March 21, 2022
