The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) in KwaZulu-Natal says it is opposed to plans for a government precinct in Pietermaritzburg that will include a new legislature building. The plans for the precinct which will bring incorporated provincial government departments under one roof, was announced during February’s State of the Province Address (SOPA) by KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala. At a media briefing in Durban, IFP President Velenkosini Hlabisa said the province should rather relocate the legislature to the former site in Ulundi citing that this would save a significant amount of money. Hlabisa says, “In terms of space, the existing legislature at Ulundi will accommodate more than what the members we have in the legislature of KwaZulu-Natal currently. And if you go to the total legislature including the guest it can take up to 500 people. That is more than what we need.” KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala identifies 8 priorities for the province in SOPA:

The IFP leader says the party is prepared to legally challenge the move. “We will take this matter to the legislature and raise it formally so that we can be provided with a resolution because in 1994 there was a formal resolution for the usage of the two areas Pietermaritzburg and Ulundi. Formally taken in the house and the national government and the national government will not allow the province of KwaZulu-Natal to duplicate what exists. if they do what is against the law we will definitely consider a legal road.” | IFP TO HOLD PRESS CONFERENCE KZN LEGISLATURE PRECINCT IFP President & Leader of the Official Opposition in @KznLegislature, Hon.
