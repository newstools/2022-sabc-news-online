The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) says it will be focusing on prosecuting high profile corruption cases in the next six months. The NPA which has been criticised for dragging its feet in prosecuting high profile cases, has told Parliament it has received the financial injection it requires from the National Treasury to begin its work. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Advocate Shamila Batohi says more funding was needed to strengthen their prosecuting capacity due to the complex nature of most of the cases. “it’s a complex matters which Mr Liese was talking about … they are the ones that give us challenges. We are certainly working in that capacity and we have the resources that we need in terms of the budget. But it then brings me to the question that was raised by honourable Jaco.” “You [asked] what is the life span of the case? It’s very difficult to say. It depends of course on the complexity of the case and [national head of the Hawks], Lieutenant-General, Godfrey Lebeya can come in on this. And also it depends on the resources, on whether you have the resources to ensure that investigations moves speedily,” adds Batohi.

SIU head Advocate Andy Mothibi says about 1 800 cases have been referred to the NPA for possible prosecution. “We do accept that these referrals are subject to the NPA processes. But by law, we are enjoined to refer as the legal framework was projected. We are enjoined to refer evidence that points to criminal activity and then from there on they are subject to NPA processes,” adds Mothibi.
