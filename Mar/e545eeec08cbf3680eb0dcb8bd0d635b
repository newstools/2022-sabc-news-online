Chairperson of the National Council of Provinces Enock Mthethwa says this week’s visit to KwaZulu-Natal to look at the state of police stations in the province will be compiled into a report with recommendations. The team has visited the Manguzi police station in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The area is plagued by cross-border crimes including vehicle theft. It is believed that some vehicles are stolen in South Africa and taken to Mozambique. Mthethwa says the visit will focus on the capacity of the police to fight crime. “Our focus this year is to deal with the issue of infrastructure in all departments. It varies in terms of provinces but in KZN we have agreed that we will be focusing on the capacity to fight crime including the state of the police in townships and rural areas and their resources after this then we will go back to the NCOP in Parliament and compile a report that will be debated in the house and take resolutions thereof.”
