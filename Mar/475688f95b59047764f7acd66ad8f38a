The total number of COVID-19 cases in the United States topped 80 million on Tuesday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. US COVID-19 case count rose to 80 003 415, with a total of 978 177 deaths, as of 13:20 Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) on Tuesday, showed the data. California topped the state-level caseload list, with more than 9 million cases. Texas confirmed the second most cases of about 6.7 million, followed by Florida with more than 5.8 million cases and New York with more than 4.9 million cases. The United States remains the nation worst hit by the pandemic, with the world’s most cases and deaths, accounting for nearly 17% of the global caseload and nearly 16% of the global deaths. US COVID-19 caseload reached 50 million on December 13, 2021, crossed 60 million on January 9, 2022, and exceeded 70 million on January 21. The BA.2 sub-lineage of the Omicron variant has become the dominant strain in the United States, according to new data released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday. The variant has been steadily rising in proportion due to its increased transmissibility compared to the original Omicron strain. The BA.2 variant represented 54.9% of new COVID-19 cases for the week ending March 26, according to CDC data. This data is up from 39% a week prior, and 27.8% two weeks before. The United States will likely see an uptick in cases caused by the Omicron descendant BA.2 starting in the next few weeks, Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute, was quoted as saying. A new report released by the US Census Bureau shows that half of all US states have more deaths than births in a 12-month period, and COVID-19 was the leading cause, according to a report of ABC News on Saturday.
