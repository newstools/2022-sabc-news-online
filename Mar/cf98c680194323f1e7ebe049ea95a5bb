The African National Congress (ANC) National Executive Committee (NEC) is meeting in an ordinary session over this weekend, including meeting with the different structures of the party until Sunday. Top on the Agenda in the virtual meeting is to tackle the challenges around the built-up to the Provincial and Regional Conferences of the ANC Youth League, the Veterans League, and the ANC Women’s League. The party has seen a number of Provincial Elective conferences, including in Mpumalanga and Eastern Cape, being postponed due to logistical challenges. This saw the two province’s Executive Committees being dissolved and there was an appointment of Task Teams, who are organising the elective conferences.
