KwaZulu-Natal Premier Sihle Zikalala has called for a review of South Africa’s constitutional democracy and has advocated for a move towards a Parliamentary system in which decisions taken by Parliament are final. Zikalala was addressing the province’s Human Rights Day celebration at Ixopo on the KwaZulu-Natal south coast. Zikalala has raised concerns that some decisions taken by government are being reviewed and reversed by courts. “While we all have respect and we uphold the independence of the judiciary,  we need to review the dilemma imposed on us by the current system of the constitutional democracy. This system places one organ of the state above others . It is time we discuss this , it is time we debate it openly,  we make policies to govern but if courts are to reverse those policies , they mean that they are undermining the authority of other organs.” President Ramaphosa calls on South Africans to cherish the Constitution and not to be humiliated President Cyril Ramaphosa says South Africans will not tolerate being humiliated in their own country. He says people in the country suffered 340 years of humiliation and this cannot be tolerated anymore.This comes amid continued reports of racist incidents in the country almost 30 years since the advent of democracy. “One of the rights we should cherish in our Constitution, whether clearly articulated or not is the right not to be humiliated. The apartheid horror was about humiliating the black people of this country and we must say no. We are no longer going to allow anyone to humiliate us. We reject humiliation. We don’t want to be treated as sub-humans.” ‘Respect the rights of all’ Ramaphosa has further called on the public to respect the rights of all people and refuse to be humiliated or treated as sub-human.
