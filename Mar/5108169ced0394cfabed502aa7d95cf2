Eskom has cut electricity to the Garona Building in Mahikeng, which houses different North West government departments. The power utility says this is due to the delay in payments. It is not clear how much is owed to the power utility. This has led to employees being sent home for two days in a row. Spokesperson for the provincial Public Works Department Matshube Mfoloe says they’ve paid Eskom more than R1 million. “I can confirm that in respect of payments to Eskom, all our invoices were paid and they were paid on time. There are six buildings at least in Mafikeng which we are responsible for and that includes the building of Garona and to date over R1 million in transactions in the form of payment have gone through. I’ve checked with them and there’s documentation to affect.  It is very regrettable that Eskom has disconnected power. I don’t know what the reasons are because Garona itself is like a nerve centre of service delivery while our district officers are like a coal face for service delivery.” Eskom provincial spokesperson Mogomotsi Maboe says reconnection is under way following the payment. “Eskom can confirm that electricity  disconnection did take place. This was because of non-payment from the government. We cannot disclose the amount owed. However, a payment was made today and reconnection process is underway.”
