South Africa is ready for digital migration. That’s the assurance from Communications and Digital Technologies Minister Khumbudzo Ntshavheni. Ntshavheni is on a two-day visit to KwaZulu-Natal to monitor the digital migration process. She says the process is on track for the switch from analogue to digital viewing. Households with an older analogue television will from next month need set-top boxes to view free-to-air content. The North West, Free State and Northern Cape are fully migrated. Ntshavheni says households who fail to register for the set-top box before the cut-off date will only be connected within three to six months after the switch-off date. “Come the 31st of March is what we call end and dual elimination, SENTECH will do elimination on DTT. Switch-off is going to take place. We are encouraging our people that when the switch-off takes place if you have not applied. You are still going to apply at your post office or registrations.gov.za. It is zero-rated so you don’t have to pay anything when you apply there. You can apply with your R100 phone. It doesn’t need a feature or a smartphone. Those who apply after the 31st of October and those who apply after their switch off we will connect them after 3 to 6 months of the switch-off,” says Ntshavheni.
