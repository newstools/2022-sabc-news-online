The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa, Numsa, says it has taken Gautrain to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) after workers were suspended for refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The union has also accused Gautrain’s management company, the Bombela Operating Company, of failing to consult labour on vaccination mandates. Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, says that they’re only aware of one case where the CCMA found in favour of the employer regarding vaccine mandates, and they believe it was questionable. She says government has not made a decision with regards to vaccine mandates. “Gautrain had a duty to consult us, they never did, and what we find strange about Gautrain’s exemption policy is that every single one of the 27 members who were reluctant to vaccinate, and some of them actually had very clear medical reasons why they couldn’t do so, were rejected. We’ve got a very strong foundation, for us to take this case all the way to the constitutional court if necessary, in order to affirm the rights that are already enshrined in the constitution, when it comes to this issue of vaccines.” Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola speaks to SABC News on the challenge against Gautrain:
