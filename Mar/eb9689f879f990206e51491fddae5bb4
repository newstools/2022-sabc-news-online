The Department of Home Affairs says a Pakistani Kingpin, allegedly behind the syndicate falsifying passport documents, has been arrested in a late-night sting operation. The department and the Hawks raided a Home Affairs office in Krugersdorp, Gauteng, where around 30 suspects were arrested. It has emerged that locals, with no prospects of travelling, were lured into the syndicate by selling their identities to undocumented migrants posing as asylum seekers and refugees. Home Affairs Minister, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, says more arrests are imminent. “It is a sting operation to catch the kingpin. There are SA Home Affairs officials who are already serving jail terms. We have been following up for a long time and eventually, we lured him here to this office to conduct this nefarious operation so that he could be caught. This kingpin is married to a South African who stays in Eldorado Park and I think he married her just to get permanent residency in SA. This is criminal. They will face charges in terms of the Identification Act and in terms of the Immigration Act.” Motsoaledi says he will not allow the Constitution to be undermined by those processing fraudulent passport documents. It has emerged that locals, with no prospects of travelling, were lured into the syndicate by selling their identities to undocumented migrants posing as asylum seekers and refugees. Dr Motsoaledi says more arrests are imminent. “They are making us fools and some of them even say the SA Constitution allows you to do any hooliganism. That must come to an end. I am not going to accept that.”
