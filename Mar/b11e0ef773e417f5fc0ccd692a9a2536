Summerfield Dynamos are through to the quarter-finals of the Nedbank Cup after beating Black Eagles FC by a single goal to nil in Durban earlier on Sunday afternoon. Dynamos needed extra time to find the winner against fellow ABC Motsepe opponents. Eagles who had an opportunity to win the match in regulation time, conceded an own goal in the first minute of extra-time allowing Dynamos to progress to the next round of the competition. Dynamos keeper, Bongani Masoga, denied Eagles on several occasions in the opening half. Eagles were awarded a penalty in injury time after a foul in the danger area. Dynamos keeper Mosoga continued with his heroics as he saved the late spot-kick to send the game into extra time. Then the visitors got punished in the first minute of extra time with defender, Tumelo Bodibe, scoring their own goal.
