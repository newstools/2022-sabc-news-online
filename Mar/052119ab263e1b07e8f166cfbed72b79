Public Protector Advocate Busisiwe Mkhwebane, together with her deputy, has met with the Eastern Cape Premier Oscar Mabuyane his executive and traditional leaders. Mkhwebane and her deputy Advocate Kholeka Gcaleka highlighted the issues they are investigating in the province. This is the last leg of the Public Protector’s nationwide roadshow to engage with the provinces. The complaints they are investigating in the Eastern Cape include service delivery, maladministration and the abuse of power and resources. Mkhwebane says there are about 219 complaints being investigated. She says, “ So we are bringing that to them to show them these are the complaints the public are having, therefore, they need to resolve them but then it will also help them to improve on service delivery, also bringing to the speaker the reports which we have issued which are not implemented. Those ones we are saying to the speaker can she make sure that she refers those to various committees, the committees should hold the executive to account on how they are implementing.” Mkhwebane says her office is also in the province to make sure that municipalities work hand in hand with traditional leaders, especially on issues linked to development. She says, “There is a report that we have issued about the role of traditional leaders in the various municipalities. The law demands that when they see that they should be consulted and municipalities should make sure that when they develop their areas, they should involve them in their budgets so that when they do that they work collaboratively.” “We are here also to say let the spirit of collaborative governance be promoted because we cannot have a situation where the municipality is pulling that side, the traditional leadership and the province is pulling that side,” Mkhwebane adds.
