Former Zambian President Rupiah Banda, 85, died on Friday after a battle with colon cancer, his son told Reuters. “He died around 1900 hours today,” said his son Andrew, Banda’s second eldest child, confirming the death. Banda, Zambia’s fourth president, who was in power from 2008 to 2011, was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and had been receiving medical treatment. Banda was born in the town of Miko, Gwanda, Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe); his parents had come from Northern Rhodesia to find employment prior to his birth, and he was sponsored by a local Dutch Reformed Church preacher and later, the family of B. R. Naik, a family of Indian origin, to continue his education into adulthood. He became involved in politics when he joined the youth wing of the UNIP in 1960. Rupiah Banda is one of the notable alumni of Rusangu University, Zambia. – additional info from Wikipedia
