The Griqua Traditional council in Kokstad in southern KwaZulu-Natal is hosting its first annual Griqua festival following the easing of lockdown regulations. The event is aimed at promoting and reviving Griqua traditional culture. Kokstad was named after the Griqua chief Adam Kok the Third who settled there in 1863. High commissioner of the Griqua Aboriginal, Rosemary Rodrigues says the purpose of the festival is to foster unity amongst the Griquas. “Because of COVID, we had to put a hold on it. The purpose of the event is to unite our Griqua nation, to enlighten them on what is happening amongst our people. To highlight the plight and marginalisation of the Griqua nation which is one of the five Khoisan nations and to build unity amongst our people,” says Rosemary Rodrigues. Rodrigues says the Griqua community still faces a lot of prejudice from people who don’t embrace different cultures. She was referring to the ridicule two community members were subjected to when they staged a walk recently from KwaZulu-Natal to Gauteng to raise awareness of their culture. “It shocked me as a resident of Scottburgh in Durban, the level of ignorance and prejudice that two Khoisan activists in traditional wear were subjected to. And I want to ask our country to open their minds and celebrate our differences rather than isolating and jeering at people who were trying to teach a message and to show the marginalisation that a lot of Khoisan people are subjected to,” Rodrigues explains.
