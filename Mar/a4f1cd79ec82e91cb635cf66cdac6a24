Former Vice-Chancellor of the University of the Free State, Professor Jonathan Jansen, says he will always cherish the courage displayed by freedom fighter, Don Mattera in fighting against the “classification” of the people in South Africa. He says Mattera set a good path for generations to come, that they must refuse to be confined in terms of race, culture, and educational background. Professor Jansen was delivering the inaugural memorial lecture of the Order of Ikhamanga recipient, Don Mattera, in Sandton, Johannesburg. “Donato Francesco Mattera seems to me, who defies classification. And that is a very different thing to say in a county that is out of fixing people’s classification in terms of race, culture and religion, and the likes. But Don Mattera actually defies in his very life and being any form of classification.” Don Mattera Inaugural Lecture:
