Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe says government is looking at the pros and cons of the exploration of gas and oil in South Africa. This amid criticism that the world is moving away from fossil fuels toward greener energy sources in a bid to combat climate change and South Africa has abundant green energy resources. Mantashe was addressing traditional leaders and the community of Flagstaff in the Eastern Cape during a visit which was part of engagements in providing clarity on the seismic survey in the area. Environmentalists are opposed to the initiative and filed a lawsuit to halt the process. Mantashe says efforts are in place to minimize all the risks. “It is in our interest to see the Eastern Cape developed. If we don’t work aggressively to develop the Eastern Cape we are not going to temper with the architecture of our economy as designed by the apartheid government…We must develop the country in other provinces so that there is a `balanced economy of the country. People must know what is being stopped that can change the Eastern Cape, it must be developed,” says Mantashe. Renewable energy needs to be accelerated
