Sentencing proceedings of the Tanzanian national convicted of murdering Matwetwe actor Sibusiso Khwinana, has been postponed to the 20th of April due to the unavailability of a Swahili translator in the Pretoria High Court. Julius Lucas was found guilty of murder after stealing his phone and stabbing Khwinana to death outside the Sterland mall in Pretoria in 2019. Tanzanian national Lucas has been found guilty of murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances and contravening the immigration act. Judge Portia Phahlane says: “This means unfortunately today we cannot proceed with the sentencing procedure. We do not have a Kiswahili translator. So, for that reason, the matter is going to be postponed to the 20th of April, which is on a Wednesday. You are going to receive the sentence on this particular day. You therefore remain in custody until then.” More details in the report below:
