Umgeni Water, in conjunction with the ILembe District Municipality in Durban,  will be conducting emergency repair work to the lower Tugela pipeline on Tuesday.  As a result, water supply to areas between Mandeni and KwaDukuza will be interrupted from 6am until 6pm on Tuesday “The pipeline will be shut down for 12 hours for essential repairs to be done to two leaks. These leaks are quite serious as they pose a risk to property and people living in the vicinity of the pipeline. So the work has to be conducted on an emergency and essential basis. The pipe will be out of commission for 12 hours during which the water will be drained and welding will take place. We expect the work to be completed by 6 tomorrow evening after which the pipe will be filled again and water will be supplied to ILembe District Municipality for distribution to consumers,” says  Umgeni Water Spokesperson, Shami Harichunder.
