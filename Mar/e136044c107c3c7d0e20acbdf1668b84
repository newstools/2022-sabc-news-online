This prompted another council meeting that has seen the appointment of former acting municipal manager, Anele Qaba, into the same position. Speaker, Gary van Niekerk explains. “We resolved that we rescinded the decision of the mayor to appoint permanent city manager, based on the fact that there was no quorum. And there was no resolution for the council to appoint a city manager. So we’ve removed the so-called city manager, and we have appointed an acting city manager, Anele Qaba.” Mayoral spokesperson, Thango Lamani says the current presiding officer’s membership was terminated. “All that happened today, that was the council meeting convened by the former speaker councillor Gary van Niekerk is null and void. Whatever decisions they took today is null and void. The process and status quo remain that the three seats of the Northern Alliance political party are vacant and there is a process in place to fill those vacancies,” says Lamani.
