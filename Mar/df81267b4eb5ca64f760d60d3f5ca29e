The first batch of health supplies provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) for Ukraine has arrived in the western city of Lviv and is ready for distribution, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said on Monday. At a warehouse on the outskirts of the city, recently arrived WHO health support, including medial supplies for treating wounded and essential medicines for other diseases, are ready for distribution. “This place will serve us to (receive) medical supplies that we will then, hopefully, be able to deliver to health facilities across the country. Already in the first few days we brought 36 metric tonnes of medical material, mainly needed to treat wounded people and perform surgeries. As well, there were some essential medicines for other sorts of diseases,” said the spokesman. WHO is now talking with the Ukrainian Ministry of Health to define exact needs so as to have more targeted deliveries in the coming days and weeks. The organization is working closely with its offices in Ukraine and neighboring countries, along with health partners, to rapidly respond to the emergency in Ukraine and to minimize disruptions to the delivery of critical health services.
