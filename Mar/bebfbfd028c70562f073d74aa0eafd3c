The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) in the Northern Cape believes three SANDF members should face criminal charges. The three South African National Defence Force (SANDF) soldiers are facing charges of grievous bodily harm, malicious damage to property and common assault. They allegedly assaulted police officers in October 2022 in Jan Kempdorp. The trio face a further charge of contravention of the disaster management act. They are expected to appear in the Jan Kempdorp Magistrate’s court on March 30, 2022. NPA spokesperson Mojalefa Senokoatsane says, “As the National Prosecuting Authority, we do believe that these three members of the South African Defence Force have a case to answer to. They will be back in court so as to be able to set up a date as well as consultations.”
