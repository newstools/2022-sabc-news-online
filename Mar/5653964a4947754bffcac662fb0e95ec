President Cyril Ramaphosa says government is in the process of reducing bureaucracy for emerging businesses in an attempt to enhance economic growth and create employment. During his State of the Nation Address last month, Ramaphosa announced the appointment of Sipho Nkosi as head of a team in the Presidency to cut red tape across government departments. On Monday, the  Small Business Development Minister, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams said her department was working closely with the new Red Tape Reduction Office to develop standardised regulations that reduce bottlenecks such as licencing costs, particularly at municipal level.

We are undertaking far-reaching reforms in energy, telecommunications and in our ports and railways to improve the competitiveness of our products.” Earlier Ramaphosa  emphasised the importance of producing and buying locally to boost the country’s economy at a time when it has been brought to its knees by the COVID-19 pandemic.
