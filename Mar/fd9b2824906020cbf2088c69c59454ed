The Johannesburg Specialised Crimes Court sitting in Palm Ridge has issued a warrant of arrest for former Eskom contracts manager, France Hlakudi, for his non-appearance in court on Tuesday. He has also provisionally forfeited his bail of R300 000 to the state. Hlakudi is a co-accused in the R745-million case related to the construction of Eskom’s Kusile power plant, and is facing charges of fraud, corruption, and money laundering. Investigating Directorate spokesperson, Sindisiwe Seboka, says: “The state requested, and the court granted that the warrant of arrest is issued against Frans Hlakudi who is Eskom’s former contracts manager for his failure to appear in court today. Additionally, his bail of R300 000 has been forfeited. Final forfeiture will take place on the 13th of April.” Bid to remove fraud charge dismissed In April last year, Hlakudi’s application to have fraud removed from his charge sheet was dismissed by the Pretoria Regional Court. Hlakudi is charged with contravening the Tax Administration Act in his personal capacity and as director of the companies for allegedly not declaring his income. He faces 44 charges of tax fraud to the tune of R30 million. -Additional reporting by Maluti Obuseng
