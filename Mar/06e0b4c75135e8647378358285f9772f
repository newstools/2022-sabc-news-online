The Greytown Regional Court has sentenced a man to life imprisonment for rape at a hostel in Greytown in the KwaZulu-Natal midlands. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Spokesperson, Natasha Kara, says the woman was walking to the hostel where she lived when she was approached by Isaac Mabaso. Kara says he punched her and dragged her to a nearby plantation. “The Greytown Regional Court sentenced Isaac Mabaso to life imprisonment for the rape of a 40-year-old woman in March 2020 at a hostel in Greytown. The National Prosecuting Authority welcomes the finalisation of this matter, and we hope that this sentence will help curb the scourge of gender-based violence by deterring likeminded people.” Common rape areas Police say most rapes in the third quarter of the 2021-2022 financial year occurred at the residence of either the victim or the perpetrator. Briefing Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on Police last month, South African Police Service (SAPS) Head of Crime Research, Major-General Norman Sekhukhune said such places account for 5 012 cases. Other places include streets, open fields and recreational parks. Meanwhile, 61 cases of rape were reported at educational institutions.
