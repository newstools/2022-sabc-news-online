The Mooi family has described the late DJ Dimplez as a gentle giant. Boitumelo Mooi, popularly known as DJ Dimplez, passed away last Sunday after succumbing to a brain haemorrhage. Dj Dimplez will be remembered for helping to create space for South African hip hop through his creativity and unique sounds. ‘ His list of hit songs includes We Ain’t Leaving, in which he featured Anatii and L-Tido. His cousin David Mooi has paid tribute to him during a private funeral service. “Please allow me to refer to this gentleman as the gentle giant. The giant as in having a big heart. It has been very difficult for me. Tumi was admitted on the 5th and the family was then told Tumi is brain dead. So, when a person is like that, God has made the call. Tumi passed on in the presence of his family.” Tributes Following the news of his passing, other djs, artists and his fans took to their social media profiles to express their grief. Dj Dimplez was an all round good guy. Very kind , positive guy who always gave advice to better others. Even if Dj Dimplez didn’t agree with you, he would put it in a manner that wouldn’t offend you. Gave me and others an opportunity to grow and show thier talent. RIP grootman. — Don Billiato (@casspernyovest) March 7, 2022  I am so shocked at the passing of DJ Dimplez, perhaps the shock is having to see so many deaths of Hip Hop artists in a short space. I went to Wits University with Tumi. He was part of the Wits DJ Society. Condolensces DJ Dimples | South Africa | Metro FM pic.twitter.com/7K661YYz70 — Paul Preaches (@paulpreaches) March 7, 2022  .
