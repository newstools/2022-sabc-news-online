Eskom has announced that rolling blackouts will be suspended from 20:00 Sunday night. In a recently released statement Eskom says that there has been a sufficient recovery in generation capacity. Eskom suspends rolling blackouts:  On Monday Eskom had announced that Stage Two blackouts would be implemented from 7 pm on Monday until 5 am on Tuesday morning and then on Tuesday until Wednesday. Eskom then escalated blackouts from stage two to Stage Four from 9 am on Wednesday morning due to further generation capacity issues. “We would like to thank the people of South Africa for their support and patience during the
period of loadshedding. Eskom takes its mandate of supplying electricity to South Africa seriously and is fully aware of
the impact loadshedding is having on the whole country. Unfortunately, at times, it becomes
necessary to implement loadshedding in order to protect the system and prevent a blackout.”
