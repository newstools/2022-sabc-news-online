The National Institute of Communicable Diseases  (NICD) has reported 1 560 new COVID-19 cases that have been identified in South Africa, which brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases to 3 710 766. This increase represents a 6.2% positivity rate. The majority of new cases today are from Gauteng Province (35%), followed by Western Cape (25%). The institute says there may be a backlog of COVID-9 mortalities due to the ongoing audit exercise by the National Department of Health (NDoH). “Today, the NDoH reports seven deaths and of these, one occurred in the past 24 – 48 hours. This brings the total fatalities to 99 939 to date,” says the institute in a statement. 23 701 064 tests have been conducted in both the public and private sectors.
