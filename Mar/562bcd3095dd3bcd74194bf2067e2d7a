The Durban University of Technology (DUT) has temporarily closed four of its campuses following violent protests on Thursday. In a statement, the DUT says while the four campuses will be temporarily closed with immediate effect, the academic programme will continue online. The university says protesters did not only break COVID-19 protocols, but damaged property and traumatised staff. The university is calling it a well-orchestrated, violent attack. They say this happened despite early pleas to police for assistance. At this stage it remains unclear why students are disgruntled.
