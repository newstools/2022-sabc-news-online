The Special Investigating Unit (SIU) argued before the Special Tribunal on Tuesday that the Digital Vibes contract was a money-laundering scheme designed to syphon funds to former Health Minister Zweli Mkhize’s family while also shielding the family from accountability. Judgment was reserved in the matter, seeking to set aside the R150 million contract between Digital Vibes and the Department of Health. The matter also seeks to recover funds linked to the contract. The spokesperson for the Special Tribunal, Advocate Selby Makgotho, says the application preceded the main review application, but their investigation showed that more respondents who also benefitted, needed to be added. Makgotho says, “All Out Trading is alleged to have received R1.90 million, Thusokuhle farming R1.2 million, Azwekele Trading Projects and Mrs Zithokozile Khaliphe Mkhize R1.8 million, Cedar Falls properties, which Mrs Mkhize is understood to be the shareholder R1.8 million, and Sirela Tradings CC R585 000. These payments constituted gratification directly benefitting the family members of the former Health Minister.”
