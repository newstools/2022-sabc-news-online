President Cyril Ramaphosa has recognised King-Elect MisuZulu kaZwelithini as the King of the AmaZulu. In a statement on Wednesday, Ramaphosa says this follows consultation with the Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the Premier of KwaZulu-Natal. Misizulu ascends to the throne after the death of his father King Goodwill Zwelithini Zulu in March last year. King-Elect MisuZulu kaZwelithini was named by his now late mother, the Regent Queen Mantfombi Dlamini-Zulu as the successor. The Presidency statement mentions that the assumption of the throne by His Majesty King Misuzulu Zulu is a moment of great significance in the proud and distinguished history of AmaZulu. “His Majesty is the successor to a long line of revered monarchs, who fought with great courage and determination for the welfare and security of their people. I join all the people of South Africa in wishing His Majesty King Misuzulu Zulu a long and prosperous reign.” The announcement and recognition come in terms of Section 8(3)(a) and (b) of the Traditional and Khoi-San Leadership Act of 2019.
