A former McDonald’s employee has been sentenced to 10 years imprisonment by the Pretoria North Magistrate’s court for extortion and malicious damage to property. In 2017, Clement Othusitse Seothaeng, without showing his face recorded himself spitting in a McFlurry ice cream while at work at Mcdonald’s restaurant in Montana. He then sent the clip to the manager with a different number as a concerned customer demanding R150 000 to avoid the video circulating on social media. The manager then approached the police and a trap was set. The 27-year-old from Pampierstad in Northern Cape was given 10 years for extortion and five years for malicious damage to property. The sentences will run concurrently. NPA spokesperson, Lumka Mahanjana says “The NPA welcomes the sentence of a former McDonald’s employee who was sentenced by the Pretoria  North Magistrate’s Court to 10 years direct imprisonment after he was convicted of extortion and malicious damage to property.”
