KTM rider Miguel Oliveira put on a wet-weather masterclass and held off reigning world champion Fabio Quartararo in an intense battle to win the Indonesia Grand Prix in Mandalika on Sunday as MotoGP returned to the country after a 25-year absence. Oliveira finished ahead of Yamaha’s Quartararo, who started from pole, while Pramac Ducati’s Johann Zarco came third in the rain-delayed second race of the season. Six-times MotoGP champion Marc Marquez missed the race, Indonesia’s first grand prix since 1997, after suffering a concussion following a crash in the warm-up session earlier on Sunday. The race was reduced to 20 laps from 27 due to safety concerns caused by extreme track temperatures before the start was delayed repeatedly because of torrential rain. Moto2 Somkiat Chantra of the Idemitsu Honda Team Asia became the first Thai rider to win a Grand Prix. Chantra led from the first corner to the finish line to beat World Championship leader Celestino Vietti of Italy by 3.2s, with Spain’s Aron Canet finishing third for his second podium appearance of the season. Moto3 Leopard Racing’s Dennis Foggia won the Moto3 race, the Italian dominating to claim his first victory of the season and to take the World Championship lead. Spain’s Izan Guevara took second place and compatriot Carlos Tatay, who had been on pole, recovered from a penalty to earn a third and his first podium finish.
