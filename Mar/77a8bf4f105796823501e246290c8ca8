Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has unveiled a budget of R1.8-billion for the  Department of the Premier during his budget speech in the provincial legislature. 2/4 I announced that the Department’s main budget allocation for 2022/23 will be R1.825 billion. I am pleased to note that this is a 4.6% increase from the 2021/22 adjusted budget and will assist us in risk mitigation and implementing the New Way of Work. — Premier Alan Winde (@alanwinde) March 29, 2022  The amount represents a four percent increase from last year’s budget. Winde says R41-million will go towards cyber security, with a further R81-million budgeted for 2023 and 2024. “The COVID-19 pandemic not only changed the way we live but also the way we work too in creating a new way of work. We are focused on what capabilities are required to foster innovation in service delivery and a new culture benefiting our lives. This approach will be embedded in all four public service areas.” Budget lacks detail Meanwhile, leader of the opposition in the Western Cape Legislature, the ANC’s Cameron Dugmore, has criticised Winde’s budget speech, saying it lacks detail. Dugmore says the budget is geared towards marginalising poor communities. “But why isn’t this premier talking about the lived reality of potholes, of leaking drains, the sewage spewed across the streets in many of our communities, running drains, the filth, the state of our water? He hasn’t mentioned that. I challenge him today that when he responds, he must come with the ANC to actually see the service delivery (challenges) which are going on in the biggest city in our province,” says Dugmore.
