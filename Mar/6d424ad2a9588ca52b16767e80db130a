The South African Federation of Trade Unions (SAFTU) says it has suspended four of its senior office bearers. The four suspensions include SAFTU’s President Mac Chavalala, its second Deputy President, National Treasurer and Deputy General Secretary. It follows the issuing of a notice of precautionary suspension on SAFTU’s General-Secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, for the alleged breach of the labour federation’s policies. SAFTU now says it finds the decision to be unconstitutional. Vavi was speaking during a media briefing in Boksburg, Gauteng, following Saturday’s National Executive Committee meeting. “Now that we are finding ourselves in this situation, we regret it, I regret it and all of us that are here, together with the leaders of the NEC say this is perhaps the darkest hour in the federation. We have been defocused from the real issues that workers were expecting a young federation to deal with. We are not feeling vindicated or are happily rejoicing. We believe that this matter should not have arisen had we been focusing on campaigns on building the organisation,” says Vavi.
