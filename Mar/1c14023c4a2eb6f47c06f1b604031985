Opposition parties in the North West, have welcomed the withdrawal of Section 100 intervention by national government into the province. The national government has withdrawn the intervention which was invoked four years ago. Five departments, including the Office of the Premier, were placed under administration. The affected departments include Public Works and Roads, Community  Safety and Transport, Health and Education. This was sparked by allegations of rampant corruption and lack of service delivery, which led to violent protests. Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip in the provincial legislature, Freddy Sonakile says the withdrawal was long overdue. “This section 100 from the beginning, it was messed up from its protocols and memorandum of understanding and to the blurred reporting lines and even shoddy characters who masqueraded as administrators. It will be interesting also to see power handed back and some MEC’s who have been hiding under the shadow of not having any powers actually having to do their work. The exit is actually good riddance,” says Sonakile.
