The National Prosecution Authority (NPA) says many issues that have been raised by the accused in the multi-million rand asbestos corruption case in the Free State will be dealt with during their trial. The NPA maintains that it has full confidence in the strength of its case and will let the evidence speak for itself. On Monday, the High Court in Bloemfontein dismissed applications by suspended ANC Secretary-General, Ace Magashule and three others to have the multimillion-rand corruption charges against them dropped. The charges relate to the alleged irregular awarding of the R255-million asbestos roof removal tender in the Free State in 2014. “It vindicates our position because the issues that they raise in their interlocutory application should be ventilated by the trial court. We are now focussing on ensuring that pre-trial conference that is scheduled for the 10th of June 2022 is concluded. We are still confident of the strength of the state’s case, and will allow the evidence to speak for itself during trial,” NPA spokesperson, Advocate Mthunzi Mhaga says. The pre-trial hearing will start on April 10. VIDEO: Suspended ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule accused of delaying tactics in asbestos case:
