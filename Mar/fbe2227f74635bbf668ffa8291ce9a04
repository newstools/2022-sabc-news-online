Democratic Alliance leader, John Steenhuisen, has outlined reasons behind his calls for President Cyril Ramaphosa to trim Cabinet, saying the number of people occupying executive office is not proving effective in ending the country’s woes. The DA’s motion of no confidence in Cabinet was defeated at the National Assembly yesterday, with 131 voting for it and 231 against. Steenhuisen says despite the outcome of the vote, he believes Cabinet members remain ineffective and incompetent as evidenced by rolling blackouts, the high unemployment rate, fuel price increases and corruption. “The reality is that we need to keep the pressure up on Ramaphosa to get rid of this poverty Cabinet and replace it with a smaller, trimmed down Cabinet that is more focused on getting the work done in SA. I made a point yesterday that a country like Argentina has 21 MPs, China has 20 MPs. We have 38 plus deputy ministers. People are occupying executive office in SA and yet, we have not beaten poverty, unemployment or hunger.” No Confidence Debate | Democratic Alliance’s motion of no confidence in Cabinet defeated:
