The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) in Bloemfontein has dismissed former President Jacob Zuma’s fourth attempt to challenge his corruption trial. The SCA found that Zuma’s petitions had no reasonable prospects of success in an appeal and there is no other compelling reason why an appeal should be heard. Zuma had asked the appeal court for the right to challenge Judge Piet Koen’s dismissal of his special plea application. In his special plea application, Zuma sought the removal of prosecutor Billy Downer because of alleged bias and misconduct, as well as his case that witnesses should be called to testify about the abuses he claims to have suffered at the hands of the state. The trial date for Zuma’s corruption trial was set for April 11. The video below is the January court proceedings of Zuma’s legal bid to remove Adv. Downer as prosecutor:  Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the Jacob Zuma Foundation dismissed the legal pursuit by trade union Solidarity as frivolous. Spokesperson of the foundation, Mzwanele Manyi, said they deem the action by the trade union as a promotion of Chief Justice Raymond Zondo. Members of the trade union gathered at the Brooklyn Police Station in Pretoria to lay charges of corruption, fraud, theft and mismanagement against, among others, former President Jacob Zuma, the former chairperson of SAA Dudu Myeni, and the former head of Transnet and Eskom, Brian Molefe.
