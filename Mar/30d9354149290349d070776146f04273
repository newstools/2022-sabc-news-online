A new South African record has been set for the heaviest pumpkin at 904.5 kilograms. The colossus was on show at the annual Giant Pumpkin Festival at Heidelberg in the Western Cape. It was cultivated by Willem le Grange from Ruiterbos near Mossel Bay. Last year, he also broke the record with a pumpkin of 867.5 kilograms. He says he was surprised that this one is so much heavier. “I didn’t expect the pumpkin to be so heavy. It worked out less when we measured it with a formula to work out its weight and it’s usually close to that. It’s a good gene pool, and we’ll definitely continue with the pumpkin’s genes. you can’t let it go to waste,” says Le Grange.
