The Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) says it is preparing to respond to a court application by lobby group AfriForum to stop a R50-million donation to Cuba. On Tuesday, the High Court in Pretoria granted the lobby group an interim interdict barring the government from proceeding with the transaction. Last year, the announcement about the hefty donation drew strong criticism from civil groups and some political parties. International Relations Minister, Naledi Pandor, says they have sought legal counsel to respond to the upcoming hearing. She’s also clarified that the donation will not be monetary. Pandor provides clarity in the tweeted video below: STATEMENT | The Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Dr. Naledi Pandor, has this morning, reacted to yesterday’s Court Ruling, regarding South Africa’s humanitarian aid to Cuba. 23 March 2022. cc @ClaysonMonyela @UbuntuRadioZA @SAgovnews pic.twitter.com/3tiQtCkIyl — DIRCO South Africa (@DIRCO_ZA) March 23, 2022  Interdict to overturn the decision AfriForum is expected to file an application next month to seek to have the decision to give the Caribbean nation the gift overturned or found unlawful.
