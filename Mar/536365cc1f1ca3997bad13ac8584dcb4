The African National Congress (ANC) says it is confident that unity and renewal will soon be realised in accordance with the resolutions of the party’s 54 National Elective Conference of 2017. The National Executive Committee is meeting virtually in an ordinary session over this weekend. ANC spokesperson, Pule Mabe says internal issues causing divisions are being ironed out. The ANC is also looking at the challenges ahead of the elective conferences this year of the Youth League, the Veterans League and the ANC Women’s League. Mabe says they are obliged to deliver in accordance with the 2017 resolutions. “It was a real test of the ability of this leadership to be able to deliver what we committed to when we left that serminal occasion of the 54th national conference of 2017. So, conferences will sit. We will receive the report on the ANC Youth League, their state of readiness and all of that – as well as the ANC Women’s League. There is a three member task team that was to engage with issues around their conference, their state of Health and all of that – we will also get a report on the ANC Veterans League,” says Mabe. ANC’s NEC is expected to reach a decision on ANCWL President Bathabile Dlamini  Meanwhile, all other provinces are set to have their elective conferences some time this year, but must be ahead of the 55th National Elective Conference of the ANC in December. It would seem the ANC continues to be embroiled in challenges, ahead of it’s National elective conference in December. The party seeks to have a program of action for it’s renewal. Also on the table is the discussion on the State Capture Commission’s report, which mentions high ranking ANC leaders. The NEC Meeting will also discuss international relations, including the Russia and Ukraine conflict. ANC NEC Meeting preview: Rebone Tau
