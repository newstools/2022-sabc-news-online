De Lille, however, says she knows nothing about this hostage situation. “It’s totally not true. In fact, the Mayor and myself diffused the situation by speaking to the shopping centre management to give us room to sit down and meet with the aggrieved small businesses. There was no hostage, nothing, only a demand to ask the police to release their colleagues. So, to correct all this, I am safe, I’m home in Pretoria today,” says De Lille. The N2 Nodal Development project which is part of government’s Infrastructure Investment Plan, is a strategic economic and housing provision intervention programme in Gqeberha. It comprises of around 12 000 housing opportunities, retail, commercial, office, social and industrial facilities. SABC News Reporter Anda Nqonji provides more details on De Lille’s visit:
