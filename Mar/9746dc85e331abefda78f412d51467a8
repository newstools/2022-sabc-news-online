E-hailing service operators are calling on government to regulate the industry. They say this will go a long way in eradicating what they say is exploitation in the industry. They say this will also help curb criminality by both operators and riders. This comes amid the arrest last month of an e-hailing driver who faces charges of rape, robbery and kidnapping. Briefing the media in Johannesburg on their planned three-day national shutdown, e-hailing service operators say they are forging ahead with their march. Among their demands contained in memorandums to be handed at the Union Buildings and to Transport MEC Jacob Mamabolo’s office among others, is for government to get involved and regulate the industry. They say this will ensure fair pricing, transparency and proper vetting of operators to weed out criminal elements in the industry. They’ve assured the public that the three-day strike will be peaceful and that operators who choose not to take part, will not be intimidated or coerced into joining the mass action.
