A rally to honour International Women’s Day in Berlin gathered in front of the Russian Embassy in order to protest the Russian invasion in Ukraine on Tuesday. Several hundred people, mostly women, showed their solidarity and sympathy to Ukraine with placards in its national colours blue and yellow. Among the speeches discussing women’s rights was one by Germany’s Federal Minister for Food and Agriculture Cem Oezdemir, who also addressed the current situation in Ukraine. “We help with food, we help with equipment, but we also help with weapons. Because it is the right of the people in Ukraine to defend themselves”, the minister from the governing Green Party said. Germany had formerly been criticised for its hesitance to allow the delivery of weapons into conflict zones like Ukraine, until a major turnaround on February 26. RalIies dedicated to International Women’s Day took place all over the German capital which, unlike any other German federal state, made the day a Public Holiday in 2019.
