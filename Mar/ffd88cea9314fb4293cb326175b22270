Pre-sentencing is expected to commence on Tuesday in  the theft case involving Walter Sisulu University student, Sibongile Mani and the  National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS). Proceedings will take place at the  East-London Regional Court. The court found Mani guilty on a charge of theft. She spent more than R800 thousand from the R14-million which was erroneously deposited into her account by Intellimali as a loan from the National Student Financial Aid Scheme in 2017. NSFAS has welcomed the conviction. Mani spent at least twenty thousand rand within two hours after the money was deposited into her account on items including alcohol and cigarettes. Delivering her judgement, magistrate Twannet Olivier, said her actions did not reflect those of a person acting without intentions. She remains out on bail.
