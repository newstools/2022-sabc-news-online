World number one Jon Rahm got off to a good start at the World Golf Championships Match Play tournament at Austin Country Club in Texas. The Spaniard took a convincing victory over Colombia’s Sebastian Munoz. Rahm, looking to build some Masters momentum at this week’s tournament, recovered from an early deficit to post 4 and 2 victories. Munoz had taken the early lead going one up with a birdie at the par-four third hole. Rahm immediately struck with a birdie of his own on the fourth. The Colombian then pulled away with a birdie on the 12th before rolling in a 30-foot birdie putt on the 13th to go three up. Rahm would make the most of the back-nine par-5 holes. He birdied both at 12 and 16 to clinch victory.
