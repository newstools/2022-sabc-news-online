Two exceptional women in science have been recognised by the inaugural awards of the African Network of Women in Astronomy, at the South African Astronomical Centre, in Observatory, Cape Town. The awards recognise and support the scientific achievements, and contributions to society, made by women in Astronomy, in Africa. Dr Marie Korsaga, the first woman Astronomer in Burkina Faso, received the Early Career Award. Senior research scholar at the University of Cape Town, Professor Renée Kraan-Korteweg received the Senior Award. Kraan-Korteweg says she hopes the awards will inspire more young women to pursue a career in astronomy. “I was not just honoured, but very surprised when I heard that I was the first recipient of the Senior Award and it really is an honour and I would like to also thank all the team who have set this up. I think the primary goal is to showcase women in Astronomy and what they can do and hopefully, it will really encourage young women to continue or start a career in astronomy.”
