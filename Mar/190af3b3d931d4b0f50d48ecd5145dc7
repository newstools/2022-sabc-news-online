The family of struggle stalwart Dulcie September says they will do everything in their power to ensure that those responsible for her death more than 30 years ago are prosecuted. September was an anti-apartheid activist from the Western Cape. She was assassinated outside the African National Congress (ANC) Paris offices in France in 1988. Prior to her assassination, September had been investigating the trafficking of weapons between France and South Africa. September’s niece, Nicol Arendse, was speaking during the annual Dulcie September Public Lecture at Freedom Park in Pretoria. Arendse says a lot of research has gone into investigating her death throughout the years, and the family feels that there is sufficient evidence for a criminal case. “We feel that a chance of a court case to be more successful. We need to grasp that opportunity and say here is something more than what you had at the time when she was assassinated. We still feel justice needs to be done, there are still some unanswered questions, and the people who wanted her dead, we need to know why, and we need to know who and hopefully this will help the family to get answers to those questions.” Murder in Paris film honouring September’s life In March last year, Murder in Paris, a political crime thriller that traces the motives for September’s assasination was launched. As part of the SABC’s Human Rights Day celebrations in 2021, the public broadcaster premiered the film in commemoration of September’s death.
