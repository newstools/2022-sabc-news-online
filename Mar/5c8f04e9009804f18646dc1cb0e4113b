DA leader John Steenhuisen has committed that his party is declaring war on poverty in South Africa.  He says it’s no use to celebrate Human Rights Day, yet millions of people still live below the poverty line. This as the country commemorates Human Rights on Monday. Steenhuisen was in Gemsbokpruit near KwaMhlanga in Mpumalanga today, as part of the DA’s commemoration of the day. He says government must wake up to the fact that poverty is the real enemy of citizens. “Help us to declare war on poverty, so that when we are old and Madala and our children are the age we are now, we can say we started to fight poverty and we’ve beaten poverty in South Africa. Our children are going to a good school, we have roofs over our heads and a job. And I go to bed with food in my stomach. That’s what dignity and human rights are.” [LIVE NOW] Watch as DA Leader John Steenhuisen, commemorates Human Rights Day in Gemsbokspruit in Mpumalanga. Broadcast links.
