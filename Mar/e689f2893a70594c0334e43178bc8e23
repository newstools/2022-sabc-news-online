The City of Johannesburg’s Metro Police Department (JMPD) says there has not been any disruption to operations at their Driver License Testing Centres (DLTCs) and motor vehicle registration offices. This follows a two-week strike by the National Driving School Association of South Africa over the eNatis online booking system. The Association says technical glitches continue to affect their clients, and they want to go back to the manual system. “Following the ongoing protest strike by Driving School Association regarding the eNatis system, officers are on high alert for any disturbances. We have received information today that the Association will be embarking on another strike, so officers have been deployed in various driving license centres accross the city. At the moment we haven’t received any reports of any disturbances, but we will continue to check of any disturbances,” says JMPD Spokesperson, Xolani Fihla.
