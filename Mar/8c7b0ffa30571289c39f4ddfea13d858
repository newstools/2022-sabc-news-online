A group of people from the Operation Dudula movement have staged a protest outside the Johannesburg Central Police Station where Nhlanhla ‘Lux’ Dlaimini is held. Dlamini was arrested on Thursday evening and has been denied bail. Dlamini is due to appear in the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court west of Johannesburg on Monday on charges of housebreaking, theft and malicious damage to property. This follows a case opened by Soweto resident Victor Ramerafe whose home was allegedly ransacked by Operation Dudula members last Sunday. Dlamini’s lawyer Ike Khumalo says politics are at play in this matter. “If we apply the law, then he must be out because these charges are not charges that can warrant him not to get bail. He has verified his address, he’s got properties here so he’s not a flight risk. Even before he knew that there was a case against him, he kept on saying I’m here and I will present myself,” says Khumalo. Dudula movement members protest outside the police station calling for Nhlanhla Dlamini’s release: Meanwhile, the launch of Operation Dudula in Kwazulu-Natal has been postponed after police reportedly called for Saturday’s meeting to be delayed. The postponement follows concerns by the City of Ethekwini that possible violence may arise during the launch. “The police department has raised concerns over the capacity not being ready in terms of the numbers and the mobilisation of other police from other towns in KZN, so they requested that it be postponed to maybe after the Easter holidays,” says Nico Dumakude, Operation Dudula KZN Provincial Coordinator.
