The Pan Africanist Congress of Azania, the PAC, has hosted the annual memorial lecture of the late struggle stalwart Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe. Sobukwe is one of the founding executives of the PAC which was formed on the 6th of April 1959. Sobukwe died on the 27th of February 1978. The memorial lecture held in Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape discussed and reflected on collective principles of recognizing humanity and creating equal strings for all people who live in Africa which forms part of the founding mandates of the PAC. The PAC President, Mzwanele Nyhontso, says a lot still needs to be done in this current dispensation to realise the true principles Sobukwe stood for. “So we believe that there is still a long way to go. Sobukwe died for the land but the land is still not back to its rightful owners. Sobukwe was calling for one Africa but Africa is still divided in many ways. So as the current leadership of the PAC we want to emulate the life of Sobukwe and fight for what he died for.” Close friends and comrades, Thozamile Heleni and Mandlenkosi Gayiza, who served under the leadership of Sobukwe say his determination, courage, and fearlessness played a critical role in the liberation struggle. “Mangaliso Sobukwe was the only man who stood for truth. The reason I joined the organisation was through his teachings and leadership because he believed that Africa was for Africans so all our resources belong to Africa, not Europeans. They have their own land so does the English and Russians so Africa is for Africans.” “We still keeping to the principles of this leader because in the PAC you will never see any of our members being accused of corruptions allegations because we don’t take what does not belong to us. You don’t just join this party. You must pledge to the mandates and constitutions of the PAC.” PAC hosts annual memorial lecture of the late struggle stalwart Robert Mangaliso Sobukwe
