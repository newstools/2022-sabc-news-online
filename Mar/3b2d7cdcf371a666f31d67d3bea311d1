The African National Congress (ANC) will address the media on Monday on the outcome of its National Executive Committee’s virtual meeting at the weekend. Various key issues topped the agenda during the three-day meeting. They included the framework for the party’s response to the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. Several ANC senior officials including the national chairperson Gwede Mantashe have been fingered in the commission’s report. The meeting also discussed the status of the party’s leagues and convening regional and provincial conferences. Earlier this month, the National Working Committee said the term of office of the National Youth Task Team, an entity that was given the responsibility to take the ANC Youth League to the conference as well as the Women’s League, had expired. ANC’s NEC meeting wraps up:  Unity and renewal The party says it is confident that unity and renewal will soon be realised in accordance with the resolutions of the party’s 54th National Elective Conference of 2017. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says internal issues causing divisions are being ironed out. The ANC is also looking at the challenges ahead of the elective conferences this year of the Youth League, the Veterans League and the ANC Women’s League. Mabe says they are obliged to deliver in accordance with the 2017 resolutions. “It was a real test of the ability of this leadership to be able to deliver what we committed to when we left that seminal occasion of the 54th national conference of 2017.”
