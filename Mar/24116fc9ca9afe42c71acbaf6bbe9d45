South Africa has proposed a rival draft resolution in the United Nations General Assembly that seeks to address the humanitarian consequences of the conflict in Ukraine. The South African-authored text was issued after a western-led draft resolution was circulated to member states demanding an immediate cessation of hostilities by the Russian Federation in Ukraine, in particular the targetting of civilians and civilian infrastructure. Zelenskyy calls for peace talks with Moscow, urges Swiss to target oligarchs:  South Africa abstained along with 34 other member states in an earlier General Assembly vote that, by an overwhelming majority, deplored Russia’s aggression and demanded the immediate and complete withdrawal of its forces from Ukraine. It cited the unbalanced nature of the earlier resolution which drew Pretoria’s controversial abstention and insists that the humanitarian text put forward by western nations not be politicized. The Western humanitarian draft makes reference to the previous resolution that was adopted by 141 member states and refers to hostilities by the Russian Federation against Ukraine while deploring the dire humanitarian consequences of Moscow’s hostilities. The South African draft makes no mention of Russia but calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities by all parties and encourages political dialogue, negotiations and mediation.
