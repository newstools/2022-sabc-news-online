A joint operations commission, supported by local MMCs for safety and security, the provincial disaster risk management committees of both Dr Kenneth Kaunda and JB marks was established and its first sitting was on Sunday the 20th,” says Ngcobo. The department has urged farmers and livestock owners, to abide by the movement restrictions in place in all the affected areas to prevent the further spread of the virus.  Restrictions in KwaZulu-Natal Meanwhile, KwaZulu-Natal Agriculture MEC Bongiwe Sithole-Moloi has imposed restrictions on the movement and trading of livestock in the Umkhanyakude district in the north of the province. This follows an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the area. “We came here to enforce the restrictions and also to ensure that the movement is being restricted but the impact that has been seen is that we had a few dip tanks that have been affected previously. We’re in an understanding that we must cooperate with each other. We will not allow the movement until we are satisfied. Yes, when they see that there’s nobody in sight in the area, they feel that they can maneuver and sell to each other so we’re saying we are going to look at that, as well as beef up our team,” says Sithole-Moloi.
