The youth of Kgetleng Township, in Koster, North West, have called on President Cyril Ramaphosa to address the issue of unemployment. The President was delivering the keynote speech at the commemoration of Human Rights Day at the Reagile Sports ground on Monday. The official celebrations are being held in Koster under the theme: “The Year of Unity and Renewal: Protecting and Preserving our Human Rights Gain.” The day is historically linked with the 22nd of March 1960, where 69 people in Sharpville died and 189 were injured, when police fired at those protesting against the pass law. A lot of the youth would like to see an acceleration in job creation. They argue that lack of job opportunities prevents them from enjoying certain rights that are basic. Development programmes There is also a heightened call for youth development programmes to be created. Young people want the government to create recreational and sports programmes that will keep them from mischief and eventually lead them to contributing to the national community. “We look forward to hearing one day that our community has produced soccer or rugby legends for example.” With the spotlight being on this area on Monday, they hope the situation will improve from now on. 2022 Human Rights Day I Expectations from Koster residents in North West
