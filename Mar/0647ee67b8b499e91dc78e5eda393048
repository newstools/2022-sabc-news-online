The Commercial Stevedoring Agricultural and Allied Workers’ Union has condemned the recent violence between Lesotho and Zimbabwean nationals in the Western Cape. Around 200 people mostly women and children were forced to evacuate Nkqubela in Robertson last week, and seek refuge at a local police station. The union says the unrest was a direct result of labour rights violations in the agriculture sector, including the alleged exploitation of immigrant farmworkers and the use of labour brokers. The union’s National Organizer, Karl Swart, has called on all stakeholders to intervene. “As soon as violence and tensions start, the farmers say it is not their problem and they must sort it out with the labour brokers. So, this is a potential for violence. Labour brokers create tensions. We call on all stakeholders to come together and discuss this explosive situation.”
