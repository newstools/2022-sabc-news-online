Ferrari’s last win before Sunday was with Sebastian Vettel in Singapore in September 2019. Red Bull’s race came undone at the very end. Verstappen was set for a second-place finish, but with a few laps to the end, he had to pit his car with a technical issue. His teammate Sergio Perez suffered the same fate on track a few laps later, gifting Hamilton a podium after a dismal race for the Mercedes team who struggled for pace.
