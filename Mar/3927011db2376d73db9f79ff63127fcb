The Italian government is ready to rebuild a theatre in the besieged Ukrainian city Mariupol which was devastated by a bomb attack, Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said on Thursday after a cabinet meeting. “The cabinet has approved my proposal to offer Ukraine the resources and means to rebuild it as soon as possible. Theatres of all countries belong to the whole (of) humanity,” Franceschini wrote on Twitter. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ top court for disputes between states ordered Russia on Wednesday to immediately halt its military operations in Ukraine, saying it was “profoundly concerned” by Moscow’s use of force. UNSG appeals for peace and diplomacy as conflict continues yet talks linger: Although the rulings of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) are binding, it has no direct means of enforcing them, and in rare cases in the past countries have ignored them. “The Russian Federation shall immediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on February 24, 2022 on the territory of Ukraine,” the ICJ judges said in a 13-2 decision. They added that Russia must also ensure that other forces under its control or supported by Moscow should not continue the military operation.
