Community representative Julius Moeketsi says, “Our rights have been infringed, we are from the farms and they have left us here without toilets and water. They know we have left our families because these houses are too small. So we want the government to fulfill their promises and we said to them that we want a piece of land so that we can plant something. If they cannot keep their promises, they better take us back where we come from.”
