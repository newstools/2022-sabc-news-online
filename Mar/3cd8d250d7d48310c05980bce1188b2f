Foreign nationals have raised concerns about the spreading of Operation Dudula across the country. On Sunday, its campaign launch in KwaZulu-Natal was halted by police after organisers failed to secure permission for the march. Its leader Nhlanhla ‘Lux’ Mohlauli was released on R1 500 bail after a weekend behind bars. Lux was arrested last week after an elderly man laid charges of breaking and entering, intimidation as well as assault against him. The man claims that he was assaulted by Operation Dudula members who accused him of being a drug dealer. Nhlanhla Lux released on R1500 bail: Executive Director of Africa Solidarity Network, Daniel Dina, says crime has no nationality. “Our fear is that Operation Dudula has no means to identify who is legal or illegal. If there’s a need to identify who’s legal or illegal, that should be the work of the law enforcers, the police, the Department of Home Affairs, the metro police and all law enforcement…that would be welcomed. But if it’s a bunch of criminals who want to take the law into their own hands, it makes people fear for their lives. Criminality has no nationality.” Dina elaborates in the video below:
