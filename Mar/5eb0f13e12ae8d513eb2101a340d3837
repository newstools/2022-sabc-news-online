Kaizer Chiefs will be hoping to extend their unbeaten run when they lock horns with KwaZulu-Natal-based team Golden Arrows this weekend. Chiefs have enjoyed a run of good form, winning their last 4 matches. Amakhosi will now come up against a Golden Arrows side that comes into this match on the back of just one win in their last eight matches in all competitions. Kaizer Chiefs are firm favourites to win this one. Chiefs’ midfielder, Keegan Dolly has this to say about the upcoming game. “Tough game, I thought there’s any ease game in the PSL, especially without the supporters as you know. Any way you play it feels like you playing at home because there’s no pressure. But I think we have been doing well the past few games now and it is another one we need to concentrate and focus on. I don’t think we need to focus on the end of the season, where we want to be,” says Dolly.
