President Cyril Ramaphosa has asked Parliament to give him until August for the submission of the entire report on the State Capture Commission of Inquiry including the action plan the government will take in implementing the recommendations of the commission. This emerged during the meeting of the National Assembly Programming Committee on Thursday morning. According to the committee, Ramaphosa had requested this extension after a court order granting the Zondo Commission another extension in submitting the entire report to the government by end of April. Speaker of the National Assembly, Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula, says the committee will refer the matter on whether to establish an Ad Hoc Committee of Parliament in the interim to the Chief Whip’s Forum to decide. “By the end of August, we shall receive a full programme of action which talks to the implementation of the recommendations of the Zondo Commission Report. I will request that at the appropriate forum which will be the Chiefs Whips Forum and perhaps even the Rules Committee if there is a need that we discuss this issue that we are proposing and not here in the programming committee, honourable members.” Part 3 of the report President Ramaphosa earlier this month received Part 3 of the State Capture Report.
