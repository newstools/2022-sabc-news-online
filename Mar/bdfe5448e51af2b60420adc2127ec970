The Department of Science and Innovation says the next phase of construction of South Africa’s Square Kilometre Array (SKA) satellite project in the Northern Cape will begin soon. SKA is a network of radio telescopes that will be located in various countries around the world. It will be used to conduct large scale scientific studies on the universe. Chief Director of Astronomy at the department, Takalani Nemaungani says the project will be a key driver in the evolution of the astronomy landscape in Africa. He was speaking at the second annual African Astronomical Society conference which is being held at the South African Astronomical Centre in Observatory, Cape Town. “The construction of the SKA is now set to begin, following the recent creation of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory as an inter-governmental organisation and approval for the start of the construction phase, both in Australia and South Africa,” adds Nemaungani.
