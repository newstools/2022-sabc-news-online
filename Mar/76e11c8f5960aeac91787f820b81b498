A 28-year-old woman is expected to appear in the Taung Magistrate’s Court in the North West later on Monday for the alleged murder of her one-year-old baby girl. The incident was reported on Friday last week. The grandparents allegedly reported that they saw the mother leaving the house at Dryharts with her one-year-old baby but returned alone later. Upon questioning her about the whereabouts of her child, she could not give any explanation and the police were contacted. The body was found at an open bushy area. The baby had what appeared to be a stab wound in her neck.
