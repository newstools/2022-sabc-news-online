So, it was the police who follow it up and made sure they have the necessary search warrants to enter the alleged suspects or drug pushers.” “But they go there under the supervision of the police. When the police are there it is assumed that everything is complied with. In this case, I am told that the police accompanied the members of Dudula and they went in there and searched,” adds Khumalo.
