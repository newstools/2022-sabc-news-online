KwaZulu-Natal Health MEC Nomagugu Simelane says it is concerning that young people still believe social media rumours regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Simelane was speaking during the “Sidlala Sigomile” vaccine campaign at Newcastle in northern KZN. Health authorities say the Amajuba district is one of those with the lowest number of vaccinated people in the province. “Newcastle is one of the lowest districts in terms of the vaccination numbers and we are very worried about it. We’ve decided that we will be going to all townships and all rural areas in the province but we’ve decided to start with the areas that are most affected and Newcastle is one of those. When you see the numbers of people that we have spoken to who have not vaccinated you realise why it was necessary for us to come here and you realise why in Newcastle numbers are so low,” says Simelane.
