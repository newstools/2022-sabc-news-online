The African National Congress (ANC) says it has paid the South African Revenue Services at the end of last month but refrained to divulge the amount. According to recent reports, the governing party owes the taxman over R100 million and had been given a ten day ultimatum to pay the amount. Speaking to the SABC, party spokesperson Pule Mabe said the party’s assets are not to be attached. “The last time we paid the tax collectors, SARS, was on the 28th of February 2022.  So employees of the African National Congress must know that the ANC is not about to be liquidated, assets are not about to be attached and we have not received what is law is called a Read of Execution.” On Monday ANC National Spokesperson Pule Mabe described as “fake news” media reports that the party is in trouble with the taxman. Pule Mabe says there has been no communication from SARS regarding its tax affairs:  Mabe said as far as the party is concerned it is not true, because they haven’t seen any letter of demand from the Revenue Services to pay the outstanding tax within seven days. According to Mabe the way the media reports on the matter is worrying. “This is big fake news doing rounds out there in the public. The ANC engages with SARS from time to time, as a tax collector and they’re having that kind of a relationship. So those that decide they’re going to speak on behalf of the ANC and SARS when they are neither of the institutions and the media because these are now running around on social media, deciding to run with this as if it’s news, it’s quite worrying.”
