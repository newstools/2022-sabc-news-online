Deputy President David Mabuza says South Africa has reached an agreement with Maputo on the purchase of gas from Mozambique. Replying to questions in the National Assembly, Mabuza said that Eskom is in the process of converting some of decommissioned power stations for the production of renewable energy. He has however, denied that there were any contracts between South Africa and Russia for the building of a gas plant at Koega in the Eastern Cape. “I’m not aware of these projects especially those that are Russian connected…I can safely say we have reached an agreement.” Acceleration of renewable energy The South African Wind Energy Association (SAWEA) has since emphasised on the need for more power to be generated by renewable energy sources. This as South Africa and the world faces massive oil and gas price hikes exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. In March last year, the association highlighted the opportunity to build private generation plants by independent producers, as the country contends with rolling blackouts. SAWEA’s CEO, Niveshen Govender, says while there are many alternatives, renewable energy is by far the most feasible.
