The African National Congress (ANC) Women’s League President Bathabile Dlamini says she will step aside from her position should she be requested to do so by the governing party’s top officials. Dlamini was convicted earlier this month of perjury following the 2017 inquiry into social grants at the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). She is due to be sentenced tomorrow. The ANC has a standing resolution that all members facing criminal charges must step aside, pending the finalisation of their cases and those convicted must resign. However, Dlamini has not been suspended nor has she resigned. Speaking to SABC News, Bathabile Dlamini says, “Yes, if I am called to step aside by the officials, I will do so. But also, if the Constitution was very clear on this matter – the resolution of the 54th conference was very clear on the matter, there would be no need for anyone to come and say to me step aside.” VIDEO: Bathabile Dlamini’s fate in the hands of ANC National officials
