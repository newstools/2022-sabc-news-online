The Western Cape Transport Minister, Daylin Mitchell, has called on the police and taxi organisations to do everything in their power to quell the taxi violence in Nyanga on the Cape Flats. His call comes after the petrol bombing incidents in which five vehicles were damaged on Friday. The vehicles include two Golden Arrow buses, two trucks belonging to Eskom and the City of Cape Town and a solid waste truck belonging to the city. No one has been arrested in connection with the unrest. Mitchell has condemned the violence in the area. “We condemn this senseless violence and damage to property. We have met with SANTACO and we call on them to intervene and to take all reasonable steps to preclude further misconduct on the part of its members. These are organised criminal actions that require intervention from the South African Police Services. I urge the Western Cape Provincial Police Commissioner to make available the required resources to investigate these cases using the relevant provisions of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act and to bring the perpetrators to book.”
