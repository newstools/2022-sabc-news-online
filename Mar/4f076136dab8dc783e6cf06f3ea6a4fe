Zenani says a new operating timetable will also be introduced soon. “All the stations on that line will be functional except for Parow station which has been badly vandalised and as a result, it will take longer to finalise. Our efforts are to bring back all rail services in all of the corridors as we bring them up post COVID-19 closures,” Zenani adds. Vandalism Last week, additional security measures at various sub-stations were implemented following the theft and vandalism of Eskom cables. Metrorail in Cape Town said the vandalism of crucial infrastructure is aimed at crippling the service. Zenani said a cable that feeds electricity to the main sub-station was deliberately cut twice last week. She added that the train service had already been hard hit by the implementation of rolling blackouts, leaving many commuters stranded. In October 2021, the Metrorail Management and Traffic Control Centre in Bellville was launched. The centre sees the automation of passenger rail operations, improve on-time performance, and most importantly, improved safety. More details in the report from October 2021 below:
