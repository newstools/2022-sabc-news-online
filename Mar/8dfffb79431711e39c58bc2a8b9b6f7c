The Western Cape government says 110 beneficiaries of the Farm 694 Housing Development in Mitchells Plain are expected to move into their new homes in two months’ time. The multi-million-rand project kicked off in 2019. Provincial Human Settlements Minister, Tertuis Simmers says half of the beneficiaries will come from the New Woodlands area and the other half will come from the Greater Kosovo informal settlement. “It is pleasing to note that construction is continuing to make significant progress. I am looking forward to the day when we welcome beneficiaries from New Woodlands and the Greater Kosovo informal settlement into their homes, where they will form a new integrated community. “I would also like to express my gratitude to both Project Steering Committees for their continued and unwavering support, as they are ensuring that those who are seeking to disrupt the progress that is being made in this project are not given a platform to do so,” Simmers explains.
