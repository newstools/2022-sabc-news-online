The leader of the new political party in Lesotho ‘Revolution for Prosperity’, Sam Matekane, says he is optimistic that his party will be supported by Basotho. Matekane launched a new party two weeks ago. In an exclusive interview with the SABC, the leader of the new kid in the block says he will use his business leadership skills to address the challenges of the economy in that country. He has appealed to Basotho in Lesotho to vote for his party in the upcoming national elections. The businessman turned politician says the country needs change as the coalition government has failed to deliver a better life for Basotho since 2012. “I would appeal to our people in Lesotho, the entire country to give us a chance as a new incoming movement. We are sure we can turn this vehicle around for the better and we are going to do it. We are going to succeed,” adds Matekane. Meanwhile, in 2021, Foreign Investment Network (FIN) in partnership with Forbes Best of Africa awarded Matekane the Forbes Best of Africa Leading Entrepreneur of the Year Award. The award goes to people who have shown great commitment to building novel, strong and viable business empires.
