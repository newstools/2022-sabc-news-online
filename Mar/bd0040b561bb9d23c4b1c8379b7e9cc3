Tributes are pouring in following the passing of Former Zambian President Rupiah Banda:  Banda had held senior diplomatic posts under first PresidentKenneth Kaunda before being eventually named as vice president in 2006 by then-President Levy Mwanawasa. Banda served as acting president in mid-2008 when Mwanawasasuffered a stroke. Banda narrowly won October elections the same year on a ruling party ticket. His tenure was marred by allegations of graft and in 2013, Zambia’s parliament stripped Banda of immunity from prosecution, clearing the way for investigators to arrest him for corruption-related offences. Banda stood accused of abuse of office, corrupt acquisition of public property and misappropriation of public funds involving more than $11 million during his tenure as president, but was never convicted in a court of law and did not serve any jail time. -Additional reporting by Reuters
