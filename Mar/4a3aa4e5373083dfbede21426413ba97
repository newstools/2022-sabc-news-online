Tunisian police forces have dismantled about 150 militant cells in the past six months, the spokesman for the National Guard said on Saturday. He added that some of the foreign militants arrested were planning to join “Jond Kilafha”, a group linked to Islamic State in Libya and in the mountains on the Tunisian-Algerian border. “Attempts of attacks targetting neighbouring countries were thwarted and a cell that was planning to stab the Interior Minister in the south of the country was dismantled,” Houssem Eddine Jbebli told reporters.
