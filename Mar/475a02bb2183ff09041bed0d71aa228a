People Against Petrol and Paraffin Price Increases (PAPPI) says it will begin picket demonstrations next week against the possible upcoming fuel hikes. The Central Energy Fund says consumers could be slapped with hefty petrol and diesel price increases next month. The fuel prices are determined by international oil rates and the dollar-rand value. PAPPI’s National Convenor Visvin Reddy says, “We, as PAPPI, will be embarking upon a series of protests and picket demonstrations, commencing next week.” “We are doing this in consultation with the civic organisations and we are hoping other political parties will come on board. The CEF’s latest data shows the current levels of 95 octane petrol will go up by R2.32 in April and diesel another R3 a litre. This is going to have a catastrophic impact on all South Africans.” South Africans find the ‘light side’ of ever-increasing fuel prices:  Last week, Mineral Resources and Energy Minister Gwede Mantashe said he’s in talks with Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana on the composition of the fuel price in the country. The latest fuel price hike came into effect with 95 octane petrol now costing around R21,60 a litre. Both grades of petrol rose by R1,46 a litre following rising oil prices amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The price of diesel has risen by R1,44 a litre, paraffin has gone up by R1,20 cents a litre. Mantashe said international factors have an impact on fuel prices.
