The South African Federation of Trade Unions’ (Saftu) general-secretary, Zwelinzima Vavi, says he’s in high spirits and has continued his work at the offices of the labour federation. Saftu’s affiliates have come together in a show of solidarity with Vavi after rejecting the notice of intent to suspend him. Vavi, has also rejected efforts to place him on precautionary suspension for alleged breach of the labour federation’s policies. In a letter to Saftu office bearers and executive committee, he says according to the federation’s constitution, only the national executive committee has the powers to suspend national office bearers. Vavi has assured workers that attempts to collapse the labour federation will fail. “That agenda is not going to succeed. There’s no leader of Saftu in his right mind that can fall into that agenda. It’s going to be an agenda of a tiny minority of desperate people who are determined to kill the unity of the working people. And I want to assure workers in this country that, that agenda has already failed. Look at how the unions in the labour federation have responded. We will also respond in the national executive committee.” Vavi founded Saftu in 2017 after he was ousted from Cosatu in 2015. SAFTU’s Vavi responds to his possible suspension
