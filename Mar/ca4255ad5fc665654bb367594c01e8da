Two people were killed, and six others injured on Saturday afternoon when two light motor vehicles and a bakkie collided on the R71 in Haenertsburg, Limpopo. ER24 paramedics arrived at 14h25 to find two light motor vehicles on the side of the road while a bakkie was on the opposite side. The bakkie, which had burst into flame in the collision, had been extinguished by other motorists. On closer inspection, medics found the bodies of two men lying trapped inside the bakkie. Unfortunately, both men had already succumbed to their numerous injuries. Nothing could be done for them, and they were declared dead. A woman was found lying on the road near her vehicle in a serious condition, while another woman was lying trapped inside the car in critical condition. Four other patients were seated on the roadside with moderate injuries. Rescue Services had to use specialised equipment to free the entrapped woman from the car. Once released, medics treated the patients and provided the critically injured patients with advanced life support before being transported to nearby hospitals for further care. The details surrounding this incident are unknown, but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations.
