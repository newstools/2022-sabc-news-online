Disgruntled residents in Senwabarwana, west of Polokwane in Limpopo, have marched and submitted a memorandum of grievances to the Blouberg municipality. They are accusing the municipality of corruption, lack of road maintenance and failing to complete the local stadium. The construction of the stadium started in 2018 but remains incomplete. Some protesters want the municipality to be placed under administration saying it is unable to provide services. “We are here to fight against corruption, fraud, and maladministration. We are saying our municipality must rather be put under administration. We are struggling with water and our roads have potholes when it is raining. Our children cannot go to school when it rains because of the poor roads. We are here because we are having a problem with our ward committees, they were not elected properly, they were not elected by the community.” Blouberg mayor Maria Thamaga disputes allegations of corruption and says the local stadium is being built in phases. “As Blouberg municipality, we are committed to responding to their grievances. On the delay of completion of the stadium, we will explain to the residents as the stadium is built in phases. Regarding nepotism, we don’t know anything about that. We are a new administration and thus far we have not had the budget to employ anyone yet.”
