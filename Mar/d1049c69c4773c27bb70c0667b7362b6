The African National Congress (ANC) is holding a virtual National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting this weekend to outline guidelines for upcoming regional, provincial and national conferences. The political future of the ANC Women’s League president Bathabile Dlamini hangs in the balance. Dlamini has been convicted of perjury by the Johannesburg Magistrate’s Court and has to get out of office according to the party’s step aside rule. The National Working Committee (NWC) and NEC will also receive a report on the state of the Women’s League whose term of office has lapsed, by the head of organising Nomvula Mokonyane. But the ANC’s Secretary General’s office has also seen the introduction of Dr Gwen Ramokgopa as coordinator, a move that has been seen as ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa tightening his grip on Luthuli House. ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe says the highest decision-making body has started its weekend-long meeting which was preceded by the NWC. “Overseeing is to bigger a word, too co-ordinate and to oversee are two different things.so the work of overseeing will still be done by the treasurer-general,  so for instance signing off of credentials will still be done by the treasurer-general, that task must always be performed by an official. What we are trying to do here is that the SGO is not compromised with the TG being held up because he still has to run the treasurer’s office and make sure that ANC finances are in order,” Mabe explains.
