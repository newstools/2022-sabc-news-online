President Volodymyr Zelenskiy thanked the EU for standing with Ukraine on Thursday but urged them not to be late with their membership to the union. The president said he was grateful for the sanctions imposed on Russia but noted that they had been a little late in acting. Zelenskiy addressed the EU leaders as they met in Brussels to discuss new sanctions against Russia. Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy appealed to NATO leaders to increase military support for his country against Russian forces that he warned would next target alliance members in eastern Europe including Poland. Western leaders denounced Moscow’s invasion of its neighbour as “barbarism” as thousands in besieged cities sheltered underground from Russian bombardment. The Russian invasion, which President Vladimir Putin calls a “special operation,” has killed thousands of people, sent 3.6 million abroad and driven more than half of Ukraine’s children from their homes, according to the United Nations. Weeks of on-and-off peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian officials have failed to reach a breakthrough. Meanwhile, civilians have come under heavy Russian aerial assaults and artillery strikes.
