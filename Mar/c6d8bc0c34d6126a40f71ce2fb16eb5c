The family of the late Anni Dewani says the imminent release of the man convicted for her murder, Zola Tongo, is a shame to the South African justice system. The correctional supervision and parole board granted Tongo parole, which will be put in effect in June. Tongo was sentenced to 18 years in jail in December 2010 for the murder of tourist Anni Dewani in Cape Town. In a statement, the uncle of the slain Anni Dewani , Ashok Hindocha, says the decision by the parole board to grant Tongo parole sends a message to other criminals that they can, “do the crime but no time.” Dewani was on honeymoon with her husband, Shrien, in Cape Town at the time of her killing. Tongo, who fetched the couple from the airport, had identified Shrien as the mastermind behind the murder. The British businessman was later acquitted of the murder and returned to his country. Hindocha says he can only hope that no other father loses a child like that.
