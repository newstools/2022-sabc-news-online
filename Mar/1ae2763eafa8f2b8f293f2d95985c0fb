Political analyst, Professor Sethulego Matebesi says it’s now time for suspended  African National Congress (ANC) secretary-general, Ace Magashule, to have his time in court. This after the Bloemfontein High Court dismissed the applications of Magashule and three others to have multi-million-rand corruption charges against them dropped. The charges relate to the alleged irregular awarding of the R255 million asbestos roof removal tender in the Free State in October 2014. In the video below, Magashule is accused of delaying tactics in asbestos case:  The pre-trial hearing in the matter has been postponed to 10 June. Matebesi says this is Magashule’s opportunity to prove his innocence. “This is what political leaders have been preaching to say there is all these allegations, give us an opportunity so that he can present his case. I don’t think there’s anything wrong, this whole notion that there is a political meddling within our courts. That whole narrative should be laid to bed, and this now gives Magashule and company the opportunity to go an present their case and perhaps prove South Africans wrong and not the politicians,” adds Magashule.
