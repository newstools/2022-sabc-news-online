Mark Cavendish won the 103rd Milano-Torino on Wednesday to become the first British winner of the 199-km one-day race, the oldest race on the international calendar first held in 1876. The 36-year-old Quick Step-Alpha Vinyl Team rider finished with a time of four hours, 31 minutes and 22 seconds ahead of Nacer Bouhanni (Team Arkea-Samsic) and Alexander Kristoff (Intermarche-Wanty-Gobert Materiaux). “I’m particularly happy. This is the perfect team for a one-day race. We never panicked. My team mates did a solid race for me here. This is just incredible the way they’ve led me out,” Cavendish said. “I like to win any race. I’ve already won Milan-Sanremo. So now I have won Milano-Torino as well. It’s not always a race for sprinters, so I’m happy to have my name on the same record book as some great climbers.” Cavendish enjoyed a remarkable return to form last year, sprinting to four stage wins at the Tour de France to equal the record of 34 set by Belgian great Eddy Merckx. But a crash in the Six Days of Ghent track meeting in November left the Briton with broken ribs and a collapsed lung.
