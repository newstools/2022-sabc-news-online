A large group of Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) members has gathered outside the Dobsonville police station in Soweto to assist an elderly man to open a criminal case against the leader of Operation Dudula. The man says he was assaulted when the group accused him of being a drug dealer. Members of Operation Dudula have been protesting against illegal immigrants and drug dens over the past few weeks. EFF members are outside the police station, while metres away, members of Operation Dudula have also gathered. South African Police Service (SAPS) Johannesburg district police Commissioner, Major-General Max Masha says, “Apparently there was an old man that was assaulted by the Dudula group on Sunday. So from our side and from the EFF side, we are going to support that person to open a case. And then they are here just to show support. We are not expecting anything but in case something might happen we must be in place.” The video below is reporting on the situation outside the police station:
