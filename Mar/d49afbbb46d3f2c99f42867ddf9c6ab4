The National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD)  has reported 566 new COVID-19 cases in South Africa, which brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed infections to 3 704 784. This increase represents a 3.9% positivity rate. The majority of new cases are from Gauteng Province (41%), followed by Western Cape (25%). The NICD says there may be a backlog of COVID-19 mortality cases reported due to the ongoing audit exercise by the National Department of Health. “Today, the NDoH reports nine deaths and of these, four occurred in the past 24-48 hours. This brings the total fatalities to 99 890 to date,” says the institute in a statement. 23 599 964 tests have been conducted in both the public and private sectors.
