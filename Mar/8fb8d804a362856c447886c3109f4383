The case of former South African Airways (SAA) board chairperson Dudu Myeni has been postponed to 4 May in the Johannesburg Magistrates’ Court. She is accused of naming a witness when testifying before the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture in November 2020, despite the commission’s chairperson Raymond Zondo’s order that the name must be withheld. Myeni is charged with defeating the ends of justice and two alternative charges of contravening the Commission’s Act and the Commission’s Regulations. In the video below, Dudu Myeni testifies in the video below:  The witness who testified in camera, implicated Myeni in alleged dodgy deals when she was chairperson of the Mhlathuze Water board in KwaZulu-Natal. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane says, “Yes, we are trial ready, hence we served the sermons early in March as we anticipated that today if all goes well we would be able to set a trial date. But obviously now she is exercising her rights as an accused person to lodge representations with the NPA, and now the NPA has to consider those representations and apply its mind.”
