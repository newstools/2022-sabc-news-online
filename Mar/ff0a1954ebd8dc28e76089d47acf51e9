India’s Anirban Lahiri is the leader in the third round of the rain-interrupted Players Golf Championship at the TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach in Florida. Lahiri, who has never won on the PGA Tour, is on nine-under-par through 11 holes, one stroke clear of Americans Tom Hoge and Harold Varner the Third. They still have to complete nine holes of their third round. South Africa’s Erik van Rooyen is in a tie for 11th, four strokes off the pace through nine holes, while Louis Oosthuizen is a stroke further back in a tie for 18th. The organisers hope to complete the tournament on Monday.  Anirban Lahiri leads at suspension of third-round play at THE PLAYERS.
