Political analyst Professor Siphamandla Zondi says the South African government’s decision to donate R50-million to Cuba should not be viewed in what he terms “selfish”. The International Relations Department says it will challenge the decision of the High Court in Pretoria that interdicts the donation. On Tuesday, the court granted the urgent interdict, pending the final outcome of an application to be instituted by lobby AfriForum to review and set aside the donation or the final outcome of proceedings to declare that it is unlawful and/or unconstitutional. Minister Naledi Pandor says the African Renaissance fund does not provide money but rather food, medical supplies, or any other forms of support to any beneficiary. Professor Zondi says sometimes South Africans should be responsible citizens and offer human solidarity. “South Africa does not have a shortage of money. Just recently over a billion was returned to government through Treasury. It would be a different issue if we were exhausting our budget and running out of money would be a problem.” SA-Cuba Relations | DIRCO to challenge interdicted donation: Dr Siphamandla Zondi  Earlier this month, High Court in Pretoria granted lobby group AfriForum an interim interdict barring the government from proceeding with the transaction.
