Khayelitsha residents in Cape Town say mass shootings are becoming commonplace in the area and they no longer feeling safe. This follows a recent shooting in which six people were killed in the Enkanini informal settlement. Three unknown gunmen fired shots randomly at victims in Lindela Road. The victims, two women and four men, were estimated to be between the ages of 22 and 27. A 35-year-old suspect has been arrested and is due to appear in court again on the 4th of April. Resident Andile Hombana says: “We were shocked by the gun shots hitting the wall of our shack. I folded myself behind the couch. I don’t know what happened. When I went outside, I saw a number of bodies lying on the ground. What happened is painful and we are still shocked.” In the report below, suspect arrested in connection with the recent Khayelitsha mass shooting remanded in custody:
