The taxi industry is appealing for government and police to assist in rooting out the so called “spikes” on the roads of South Africa. The Plaza Taxi Association member was gunned down in Mamelodi road this week, where passengers were also robbed of their cellphones and other belongings by the unknown attackers. Pretoria United Long Distance Taxi Association Spokesperson, Grottie Sithole says while everyone is in danger, but it is taxi drivers who are the most targets especially after hours. “Now no one is safe, even the motorists. But the most targeted [people] are the taxis, because they [perpetrators] robbed taxi passengers their bags and monies. That means [it] is too dangerous because even passengers are no longer safe and [some of them] knock off late.” “Some working at the hotels, some at restaurants and the transport should go and fetch them where they work. But now our drivers are scared to work during those times. The question is how are they going to reach their destinations,” adds Sithole.
