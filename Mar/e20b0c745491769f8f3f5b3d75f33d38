The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the group that hands out the Oscars, on Monday condemned Will Smith’s slap of presenter Chris Rock at Sunday night’s ceremony and said it had started a formal review of the incident. Smith strode on stage during the televised ceremony and struck Rock in the face after the comedian made a joke about the appearance of Smith’s wife. Less than an hour later, Smith won best actor for his role in “King Richard.” In a statement on Monday, the academy said it “condemns the actions of Mr. Smith at last night’s show.” “We have officially started a formal review around the incident and will explore further action and consequences in accordance with our Bylaws, Standards of Conduct and California law,” the academy added. Below are some of the reactions from celebrities on social media. RAPPER AND ACTOR, JADEN SMITH, SON OF WILL SMITH AND JADA PINKETT SMITH:
“And That’s How We Do It.” COMEDIAN KATHY GRIFFIN:
“Let me tell you something, it’s a very bad practice to walk up on stage and physically assault a Comedian. Now we all have to worry about who wants to be the next Will Smith in comedy clubs and theaters.” COMEDIAN AND ACTRESS TIFFANY HADDISH:
“When I saw a Black man stand up for his wife, that meant so much to me,” Haddish told People magazine. “As a woman, who has been unprotected, for someone to say, ‘Keep my wife’s name out your mouth, leave my wife alone,’ that’s what your husband is supposed to do, right? Protect you.” ACTRESS SOPHIA BUSH:
“Violence isn’t ok. Assault is never the answer. Also? This is the 2nd time that Chris has made fun of Jada on the #Oscarsstage, & tonight he went after her alopecia. Punching down at someone’s auto-immune disease is wrong. Doing so on purpose is cruel. They both need a breather.” TALK SHOW HOST CONAN O’BRIEN:
“Just saw the Will Smith slap. Anyone have a late night show I can borrow just for tomorrow?” RAPPER NICKI MINAJ:
“You just got to witness in real-time what happens in a man’s soul when he looks over to the woman he loves & sees her holding back tears from a  joke at her expense.” FILMMAKER ROB REINER:
“Will Smith owes Chris Rock a huge apology. There is no excuse for what he did. He’s lucky Chris is not filing assault charges.” ACTRESS AND MODEL JODIE TURNER-SMITH:
“and as far as that incident goes.. I am still processing. I have second-hand embarrassment for all involved.” ACTOR MARK HAMILL:
“Stand-up comics are very adept at handling hecklers. Violent physical assault… not so much.”
