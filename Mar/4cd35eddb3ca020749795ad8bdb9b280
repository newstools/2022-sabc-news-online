Danish driver Kevin Magnussen will return to Formula One with Haas this season as a replacement for sacked Russian driver Nikita Mazepin, the US-owned team said on Wednesday. The 29-year-old, who has 119 Grand Prix starts to his credit, raced with Haas from 2017 to 2020 and will partner German Mick Schumacher, son of seven-times world champion Michael. Mazepin’s contract was terminated last week after Russia invaded Ukraine. The team also ended its title sponsorship deal with Russian frim Uralkali. This follows Formula One saying it will not race in Russia this year after the country launched an invasion into neighbouring Ukraine. The Russian Grand Prix, which joined the calendar in 2014, was scheduled for September 25 at Sochi’s Olympic Park, but F1 organisers said it was “impossible” to hold the race in the “current circumstances.” When asked about the team’s sponsorship deal with Uralkali, boss Guenther Steiner said, “It’s not something which disturbs the team of the competition side and financially we are okay.” The season starts in Bahrain next week
