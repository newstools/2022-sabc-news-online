Teaching and learning have again been disrupted at the Thaba Chweu Boarding School near Lydenburg in Mpumalanga. Parents have forced their learners to stay home due to the lack of water at the school. It is reported that the borehole that the school relies on for drinking water is broken. Some of the parents say they will not allow their children to return to the school until the water problem is resolved. Meanwhile, some parents are considering moving their children to other schools. “For us, it will be a risk to allow our kids to come here because we going to say it is safe for our kids at school while they will get diseases because there is no water. Also, remember that we are living in COVID-19 times,” says one parent. “The other issue is – the food supplier is supplying food that is not good for our kids. I’ve seen that and the kids have been telling us that for some time. What we experiencing currently, this school is not going to produce what we expected as parents,” says another parent.
