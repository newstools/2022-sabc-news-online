Bafana Bafana will have to be ruthless in front of goal if they are to pull off a surprise against current world champions France. The two nations will clash in a much-anticipated international friendly on Tuesday evening in France. It’s been more than a decade since South Africa last played France. Bafana Bafana caused a major upset when they beat the highly-rated French team in the 2010 FIFA World Cup on home soil. Coach Hugo Broos acknowledges his players will have to improve against France, after playing to a goalless draw against Guinea on Friday. “We had a good performance. I saw a good game. I saw a good mentality. The only negative of that game is that we didn’t score, we had six, seven good chances so we have to score certainly once, certainly two also. We had, six, seven, eight chances so this is maybe a little bit negative but the rest, the performances of all the players, the mentality on the field, the way they played that game because it was a friendly game but we didn’t see that. They tried to win it so I’m very happy with the performance.” Bafana Bafana have failed to score in their past two matches. They had a near-perfect record in the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers scoring six goals and conceded on two. Broos says the mentality is always different when playing a friendly. “Before Guinea, I told them also okay it’s a friendly game but I don’t want to see it’s a friendly game, we didn’t see it but in the approach, it’s different also for me. I know it’s a friendly game, we need results, we need good games but it’s not the same as you start the game and you need to win so for the players they are more comfortable I think now than a qualifier but okay we have to learn that when it’s a qualifier there is pressure.”
