The South African Human Rights Commission in the Eastern Cape is holding an inquiry into the Right to Basic Education and the Regulation of School Uniforms. Participants include various civil society organisations like Sibanye LGBTI, Access Chapter 2, the Commission for Gender Equality, the Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders and the SA Hindu Maha Sabha. Issues to be explored include whether the perceived over-regulation of the appearances and uniforms of learners contribute towards a violation of their equality, dignity, freedom of expression and basic education rights?  School uniforms are a topic of interest for learners, parents and schools. However, the effect of school uniforms on the rights of individuals is now under the spotlight. SAHRC Advocate, Andre Gaum says the high cost of school uniforms will also be under the microscope. Meanwhile, the Commission for Gender Equality (CGE) says it is concerned that the Department of Basic Education’s draft guidelines on school uniforms lack a human rights framework and are discriminatory. The commission recently urged the department to make school uniforms gender-neutral, saying that the move would protect children who are members of the LGBTQI+ community against bullying. It has been reported that transgender and homosexual pupils were being bullied at certain schools in the Western Cape. Commissioner Busisiwe Deyi says children’s rights are of utmost importance. “Our uniforms should not be used as mechanisms to discriminate against gender nonconforming, transgender, and genderqueer children. There should never be a point where uniform or uniform codes of conduct should be used to deprive children of their right to access education,” says Deyi.
