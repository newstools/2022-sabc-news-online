A group of members from Operation Dudula have gathered to picket outside the Roodepoort Magistrate’s Court, where their leader Nhlanhla Lux is expected to appear. Lux is facing charges of house breaking, theft and malicious damage to property. On Wednesday, an elderly man laid charges of breaking and entering, intimidation as well as assault against Lux at the Dobsonville Police Station, in Soweto. The man said he was assaulted by Operation Dudula members after they broke into his home over the weekend, accusing him of being a drug dealer. About 50 members from operation Dudula are picketing outside the court, in support of their leader. The group is singing struggle songs and calling for Lux’s release. They say he was arrested unlawfully, and that he never committed the crimes he’s being charged with. Last night, Lux addressed his supporters outside the Johannesburg Central Police Station, where he stated that he would allow the law to take its course, and that he did not mind spending the night behind bars. Police are involved in supervising the movement Earlier, the lawyer for Operation Dudula leader said it is his understanding that the police are involved in supervising the movement’s activities. Advocate Ike Khumalo said, “What I know and understand is that Operation Dudula, whenever they do their searches, they are always accompanied by the police. So, it was the police who follow it up and made sure they have the necessary search warrants to enter the alleged suspects or drug pushers.” “But they go there under the supervision of the police. When the police are there it is assumed that everything is complied with. In this case, I am told that the police accompanied the members of Dudula and they went in there and searched,” added Khumalo. Below is the full interview with Ike Khumalo:
