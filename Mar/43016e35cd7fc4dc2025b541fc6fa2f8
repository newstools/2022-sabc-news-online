A 49-year-old man who allegedly defrauded the company for which he works of R97 000 has briefly appeared in the Blue Downs Magistrate’s court in Cape Town and has been released on bail. Hawks Spokesperson, Zinzi Hani says it’s alleged between 2015 and 2016, Marlon Morne Machelm convinced clients to pay him directly in exchange for discount on cash orders. He would then allegedly duplicate delivery invoices so the client would receive the order and once delivered he would personally collect the money. Hani says these payments were never paid to the company. He is expected back in court on the 6th of May.
