The City of Cape Town has welcomed the 25-year sentence imposed on a taxi driver who ran over a city traffic officer at a roadblock in Khayelitsha in 2020. 46-year-old Officer Deon Sampson died on the spot. 40-year-old Luvo Mlandu had been stopped by the officers at a roadblock in Khayelitsha – but fled the scene on realising that he would be arrested for drunken driving. He drove over an officer as he checked the license disk. Mayoral Committee Member for Safety in the city of Cape Town, JP Smith says he hopes the sentence will bring closure and a sense of justice to the deceased’s devastated family. Mlandu was handed additional sentences of five and three years on several counts of attempted murder of other officers and the contravention of the National Road Traffic Act. The Western Cape High Court found that Mlandu is a danger to other road users.
