The Jacob Zuma Foundation has dismissed the legal bid by trade union Solidarity against its patron and foundation Chairperson, Dudu Myeni as frivolous. Solidarity members gathered at the Brooklyn Police Station in Pretoria to lay charges of corruption, fraud, theft and mismanagement against former President Jacob Zuma and the former South African Airways (SAA) Board Chairperson amongst others. According to Solidarity Chief Executive, Dr Dirk Hermann there is a prima facie basis to pursue criminal activities after the State Capture report implicated the pair in corruption and recommended further investigations. Foundation Spokesperson, Mzwanele Manyi says, “We hold the view that this prosecution is a malicious prosecution, we think it’s a frivolous prosecution, we think it’s just a promotion of the work of (Raymond) Zondo who has failed to produce any credible evidence to convict anyone.” “It’s something that will not withstand the stringent the criminal procedure act. For us as a foundation, we’re not going to lose sleep over this because we think it’s just frivolous,” He adds. Inquiry Last year, Myeni denied instigating or suggesting that an inquiry be instituted at Eskom to suspend senior executives at the power utility in 2015. Myeni was giving evidence at the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture that’s sitting in Johannesburg. She said former Eskom board Chairperson Zola Tsotsi is the one who had requested to meet with former President Jacob Zuma and asked her to arrange the meetings. Myeni conceded that the meetings to discuss the inquiry and suspension of the executives did take place both in Pretoria and Durban, but has denied Zuma had given instructions that the executives be fired. Myeni said Tsotsi’s version of events and what was said in those meetings are misleading and inaccurate. Evidence from Dudu Myeni at the State Capture Commission:
